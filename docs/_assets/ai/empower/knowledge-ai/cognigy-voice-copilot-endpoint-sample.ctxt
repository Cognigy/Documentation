Configuration
Cognigy.AI in Front
Cognigy.AI in Front means that Cognigy.AI is your setup's primary system handling user interactions. It involves configuring the Transfer Node to manage call transfers and integrate with services like Voice Copilot. This setup ensures that Cognigy.AI processes and routes interactions effectively.

SIPREC Contact Center Integration
No Transfer Node configuration is needed. SIPREC integrates with the contact center through Session Border Controllers (SBC), sending transcriptions directly to the Voice Copilot Endpoint. In this process, traditional session and user IDs are replaced with Contact Center-specific IDs.
