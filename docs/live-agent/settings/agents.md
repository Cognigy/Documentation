# Agents

An Agent is a member of your customer support team. Agents will be able to view and reply to messages from your users.

On the Live Agent sidebar, click **Settings > Agents**.

 Your name will be listed by default as Administrator.
 An Administrator will have access to all Live Agent features enabled for your account,
 including settings, along with all the normal Agents' privileges.

## Agent Statuses

Agent statuses help manage the availability and workload of human agents, ensure consistent and efficient customer service, and provide transparency regarding the agent's availability to handle chat requests.

In Live Agent, human agents can have the following statuses:

- **Online**. This status indicates that the agent is available and actively handling customer interactions.
- **Busy**. This status indicates that the agent is currently engaged in productive activities or actively assisting a customer. While in this state, the agent may not be immediately available to accept new chat requests. Agents in the `Busy` status temporarily defer new customer interactions until they return to the `Online` status. However, for enhanced workflow management, you can activate the **Assign conversation to a busy agent** setting in the [Account settings](account-settings.md#auto-assign-conversations-to-a-busy-agent), empowering agents to efficiently handle new customer conversations even when they are occupied with ongoing tasks or interactions.
- **Away**. This status indicates that the agent is temporarily unavailable or not actively monitoring the chat system. They may take a break, attend to other responsibilities, or leave their workstation. Agents in this status cannot handle customer conversations until they back in.
- **Offline**. This status indicates that the agent is not currently logged in to the Live Agent system. Agents in this status cannot handle customer interactions until they log back in.
