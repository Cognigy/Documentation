# Live Agent Assistants

Assistants in Cognigy.AI are tools designed to support human agents in their interactions with customers. They often involve AI-powered features, helping agents provide more effective assistance and enhance the overall customer experience.

With assistants, among other things, the following can be achieved:

- Provide contextual information for the agent (CRM records, ERP data, small talk clues, and more).
- Enable quick access to resources such as knowledge base articles.
- Suggest replies (including media) that can be forwarded to the customer.

To set up your Project for assistants, choose a virtual assistant that best suits your requirements:

- [AI Copilot Bot](ai-copilot-bot.md). Refers to the personal tool for human agents. It offers a unique Flow for agents to access additional information as needed.
- [AI Copilot Whisper](ai-copilot-whisper.md). Refers to the functionality that provides assistance to live agents during their interactions with customers. It typically includes real-time guidance, suggestions, and recommendations to help agents effectively handle customer inquiries or issues. AI Copilot Whisper focuses on providing support directly from the conversation window.
- [AI Copilot](ai-copilot.md). Refers to the dedicated workspace or environment where human agents access various tools, resources, and features to assist them in their customer interactions.
