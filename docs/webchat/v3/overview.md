- **Adherence to Accessibility Guidelines**. Webchat v3 is fully aligned with WCAG 2.2 Level AA guidelines, guaranteeing enhanced readability, seamless navigation, and interactive functionality within the interface.

[^*]: If you integrate Webchat v3 with a contact center, note that only [Cognigy Live Agent](../../live-agent/index.md) and [Genesys Cloud Open Messaging](../../ai/escalate/handover-reference/genesys-cloud-open-messaging.md) support the Webchat v3 typing indicator.
For Genesys Cloud Open Messaging, the typing indicator supports a single use case: when a human agent writes a message to an end user. This way, the end user can see when the agent is typing.

If you're using Webchat v2 and looking to transition to Webchat v3, refer to the [migration guide](../migration.md).
