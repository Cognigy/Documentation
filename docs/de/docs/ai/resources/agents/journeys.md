# Journeys

Journeys are on-screen tutorials that are part of the [Help Center](https://support.cognigy.com/hc/en-us?_ga=2.198278191.165125103.1598697726-1816044957.1598697726) and provide step-by-step instructions, directly within the Cognigy.AI user interface.

The Journey overlay is activated by clicking on the button in the Top Toolbar:
<div class="right-image">
<img src="{{config.site_url}}ai/resources/images/0d06967-journeys.jpg" width="70%" style="margin-bottom: 5px">
</div>

When the Journey overlay is activated it's positioned at the bottom left of the user interface. It is possible to switch between **Journey steps**, by clicking on the **currently selected Journey**.

After completing a set of Journey steps, the Journey itself can be changed by clicking on **Change journey**.  The Journeys interface will open and individual journeys can be select by clicking on the menu button (3 vertical dots) to the right of each Journey.
