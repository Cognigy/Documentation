# Live Agent Assistants

Assistants in Cognigy.AI are tools designed to support human agents in their interactions with customers. They often involve AI-powered features, helping agents provide more effective assistance and enhance the overall customer experience.

With assistants, among other things, the following can be achieved:

- Provide contextual information for the agent (CRM records, ERP data, small talk clues, and more).
- Enable quick access to resources such as knowledge base articles.
- Suggest replies (including media) that can be forwarded to the customer.

To set up your Project for assistants, choose a virtual assistant that best suits your requirements:

- [Assist Bot](assist-bot.md). Refers to the personal tool for human agents. It offers a unique Flow for agents to access additional information as needed.
- [LA AI Copilot](la-ai-copilot.md). Refers to the functionality that provides assistance to live agents during their interactions with customers. It typically includes real-time guidance, suggestions, and recommendations to help agents effectively handle customer inquiries or issues. LA AI Copilot focuses on providing support directly from the conversation window.
- [AI Copilot](ai-copilot.md). Refers to the dedicated workspace or environment where human agents access various tools, resources, and features to assist them in their customer interactions. It encompasses the entire workspace setup, which may include customer information, knowledge bases, collaboration tools, and other relevant components. AI Copilot aims to provide a comprehensive and efficient working environment for human agents to manage their interactions with customers.
