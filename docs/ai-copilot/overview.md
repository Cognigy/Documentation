# AI Copilot

_Cognigy AI Copilot_ offers a variety of advanced features that empower agents to provide faster and more accurate customer support. The workspace is fully customizable with widgets that display the most relevant information for any chat and voice use case. When embedded into your contact center's agent desktop, it enhances the overall efficiency of your contact center.

## Key features

- Displays completely interactive micro applications in a customizable grid.
- Adds rich-media capabilities to any contact center stack.
- Stand-alone or integrated into existing contact center agent desktops.
- Shows any type of information like PDFs or even interactive 3D animations.
- Access to 100% of Cognigy.AI features, including Extensions and extensive logic.

## AI Copilot: Standalone or Embedded

You can use the AI Copilot workspace in two different ways:

- **Standalone application**. When a conversation is handed over to a human agent, they receive a link in the conversation chat that allows them to access the workspace. This workspace opens in a new browser tab.
- **Embedded application**. When a conversation is handed over to a human agent, the workspace is displayed alongside the conversation chat within an iFrame in the existing interface.
