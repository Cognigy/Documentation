Starting behaviour customization sets the tone for engagement, allowing for a tailored initial interaction, such as a greeting message or a start button. Operational settings, including business hours, ensure users are clearly informed about the availability of support. Collectively, these customization options create personalized and efficient webchat experience that aligns closely with your operational requirements and brand image.

Users can effortlessly choose from these options to quickly address common questions or navigate to additional resources. An optional Text-to-Speech toggle further enhances accessibility, ensuring a seamless experience for all users.

### Conversation Rating

The Conversation Rating feature in chat options allows users to rate and provide feedback on their chat experience, crucial for improving AI chat assistant performance.

This streamlined feedback mechanism engages users directly, making it easier to gather and act on valuable user insights.

Key aspects include the ability to activate the notice, customize the title and detailed message about data usage, and modify the submit button text. Additionally, it allows for the inclusion of a direct link to the full Privacy Policy. This setup not only informs users transparently about data handling practices but also secures their informed consent, reinforcing trust from the outset of the interaction.

### Date Picker

Anytime your Bot asks for a date input via the Webchat, it will let users select that Date through an interactive Date Picker.
At first, it will present the user a button which indicates the selection of a date.

When clicked, it will open a full-screen overlay for the Webchat. The user can now pick a date based on constraints you defined in the bot.#
