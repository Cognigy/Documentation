#### Advanced Layout Settings

The Advanced Layout settings offer parameters for managing the chat interface, focusing on input behavior, HTML styling, and JavaScript usage.

| Parameter                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Maximum Number of Input Rows           | Define the maximum limit of lines that can be entered into the text input field. If the text exceeds this limit, a vertical scrollbar will automatically appear for easy navigation through the input text.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Enable Input Collation                 | When this option is turned on, it combines all typed inputs from the 'input field' into a single message. This only happens if there is a delay of one second without any new text being inputted. However, any immediate feedback or rapid responses will always be sent right away, and this will also prompt any grouped messages to be sent right after.                                                                          |
| Input Collation Timeout                | This feature allows you to set the specific time delay that the chatbot will wait before it groups together all the typed inputs. If users don't type anything new within this set timeframe, their previous inputs are consolidated into one single message. This helps to get a full message context even when the user types slowly or sends several related messages at once.                                                     |
| Dynamic Image Aspect Ratio             | The images presented in the 'gallery', 'attachment', or 'top list item' template will not be manipulated to fit a specific aspect ratio. Instead, they will be displayed in their original proportions, filling the full width of the display area without any cropping or distortion.                                                                                                                                                |
| Disable Input Autocomplete             | Use the 'Disable Input Autocomplete' setting if you want to switch off the ability of the system to automatically suggest and complete words or phrases for all users.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Enable generic HTML                    | Use the 'Enable generic HTML Styling' setting if you want basic styling applied to HTML content within standard text messages. When this feature is activated, the system applies a general style format to HTML codes, enhancing the appearance of your text messages.                                                                                                                                                               |
| Allow JavaScript in HTML Message       | Activate the 'Allow JavaScript in HTML Message Content' setting if you want to include JavaScript functionalities, such as 'onclick' or 'onload' attributes, in your HTML messages. Typically, these elements are removed before displaying the message to minimize the risk of harmful content. Note, when this setting is turned on, these elements will not be removed.                                                            |
| Allow JavaScript in Button/Action URLs | Activate the 'Allow JavaScript in Button/Action URLs' setting if you wish to maintain JavaScript functionalities within button or action URLs in your interface. Usually, 'JavaScript URLs' that start with "javascript:" are removed for security reasons. However, if this setting is activated, such URLs will be preserved, and the embedded JavaScript code will be executed when the user interacts with the button or element. |

### Webchat Behavior

The Webchat Behavior settings enhance communication by enabling typing indicators, customizing input text, enabling speech-to-text, text-to-speech features, adjusting message delay, ensuring focus after interaction, and alerting users to internet connection status.

| Parameter                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enable Typing Indicators           | This setting enables you to see when the AI Agent is composing a response to your message, aiding in communication transparency and anticipation. When enabled, a 'typing' symbol appears signalling that the AI Agent is processing your request and will respond shortly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Input Placeholder Text             | This setting allows you to customize the placeholder text in the message input field to indicate where users can type their messages to interact with the AI agent. By default, it is set to "Type something…”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Enable speech-to-text              | Activating this feature will incorporate a microphone button in the Webchat. By using this feature, users can convert speech into written text, providing a hands-free and easy way to communicate with the AI agent. This is particularly beneficial for users who prefer speaking or may not be able to type their responses.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Enable text-to-speech              | If this setting is enabled, the Webchat provides a Text-To-Speech (TTS) feature that converts text messages into spoken voice output. This feature is particularly useful for users who prefer or require auditory feedback. Configurations for this TTS feature can be further adjusted in the Chat Options section.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Message Delay                      | This setting allows you to choose the amount of time the Webchat will wait before sending the AI bot's response to your messages. By default, the delay is set to 500 milliseconds. This creates a more conversational rhythm and reduces the feeling of an immediate automated response.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Focus Input after Postback         | This setting ensures that after a Postback button or quick reply button is clicked, the Webchat immediately redirects focus back to the message input field. This function enhances usability by providing a smoother, streamlined user experience, allowing you to continue typing without having to manually click back into the text input field.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Enable Connection Status Indicator | This setting, when enabled, shows a warning message if your internet connection is lost during a conversation with the AI agent. This ensures you're aware of any potential interruptions or delays in the chat conversation. The warning will automatically disappear once the internet connection is re-established, indicating that the chat can proceed normally.                                                                                                                                                           |

|---------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enable Unread Message Title Indicator | If this setting is turned on, it will show the number of unread messages in the browser tab title every 1000 milliseconds. This helps the user to keep track of messages that are yet to be read, ensuring no communication from the AI Agent is missed, especially when the user is multitasking and has several tabs open. |
| Enable Unread Message Badge           | When this feature is enabled, a badge displaying the count of unread messages will appear on the Webchat toggle button. This ensures users are aware of any new messages or responses from the AI agent that they have yet to view, promoting timely and responsive interactions.                                            |
| Enable Unread Message Preview         | If you toggle this setting on, the Webchat displays a preview bubble containing the newest message from the agent. This is helpful when the chat interface is minimized, as you can still get an idea of the most recent communication without having to open and read through the entire conversation.                      |
| Enable Unread Message Sound           | This setting, when turned on, triggers a notification sound every time you receive a new unread message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Background Color/Gradient      | This feature allows you to customize the color or gradient of the Home Screen background in the Webchat interface. It accepts CSS color codes or gradient values. Example hex code and gradient could be #05309e and linear-gradient(to left, rgba(1,1,1), rgba(5,48,158)) respectively. This provides the flexibility to align the chat interface's look with your brand's color schemes. By default, no color or gradient is set. |
| Start Conversation Button Text | This feature allows you to modify the text displayed on the "Start Conversation" button, giving you the option to make it more aligned with your brand's voice or to make the call-to-action more compelling.
