# Webchat v2: Supported Browsers

Cognigy Webchat v2 is compatible with the browsers listed below:

| Browser           | Version            |
|-------------------|--------------------|
| Google Chrome     | 66 or higher       |
| Firefox           | 57 or higher       |
| Microsoft Edge    | 16 or higher       |

[^*]: Cognigy only supports Websockets on Safari, which means that the fallback to long-polling is not allowed.
