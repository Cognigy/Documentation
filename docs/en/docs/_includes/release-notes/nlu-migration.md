!!! note "Cognigy NLU: from V1 to V2"
    For on-premise Cognigy v4.60 or later versions, migrating from NLU V1 to NLU V2 is necessary.
We have enhanced NLP services for scalability, security,
and reliability by dividing them into smaller, independently scalable components.
To migrate to the new version,
refer to the [Cognigy NLU: from V1 to V2](https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/installation/migration/from-nlu-v1-to-v2-migration/) guide.
The other infrastructure updates for the current release can be found in in the [Infrastructure](#infrastructure) section.
