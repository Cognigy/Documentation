Note that the generation of Flows for primary NLU languages besides German and English is not fully supported.

To use [Generative AI](../../generative-ai.md#generate-flows) technology for creating a new Flow with pre-configured Nodes based on your scenario, do the following:

1. In the left-side menu of the Cognigy.AI interface, click **Build > Flows**.
2. Click **+ New Flow**.
3. In the **New Flow** window, go to the **Flow Generation** section and select one of the options:
    - **None** — the Generative AI will not be applied to this Flow. This setting is activated by default.
    - **Name and Description** — the Generative AI will use the Name and Description fields for generating Flow.
    - **Name and Transcript** — the Generative AI will use the Name and Transcript fields for generating Flow. For this setting, you need to create a scenario and put it in the Transcript field. Use the Transcript field template as an example for your scenario.
4. Generate the Flow by clicking **Create**.

In the existing Flow, you can edit Nodes created based on your scenario. Generate new Intent sentences or responses for a chatbot.
