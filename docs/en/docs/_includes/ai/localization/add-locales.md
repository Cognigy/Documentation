Cognigy virtual agents use English as the default language. However, you can customize the language of your Flow to match your requirements when needed.

To create a locale, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cognigy.AI interface.
2. In the left-side menu, select an Agent.
3. In the left-side **Agent** menu, select **Manage > Localization**.
4. Click **+ Create new Locale**.
5. In the **Name** field, enter a unique name of the locale. This name will be displayed in the Flow.
6. From the **NLU Language** list, select a language for your locale.
7. From the **Fallback Locale** list, select a locale that will be used as default when a specific language is not available.
8. Click **Save & Build**.
