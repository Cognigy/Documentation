# Labels

Labels help you to categorize conversations and prioritize them. You can assign a label to a conversation from the side panel.

Labels are tied to the account and can be used to create custom workflows in your organization. You can assign custom colours to a label. It makes it easier to identify the label. You will be able to display the label on the sidebar to filter the conversations quickly.

Click on the sidebar **Settings** on the Live Agent Dashboard.
