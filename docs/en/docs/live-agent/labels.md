# Labels

Labels help you to categorize and prioritize Conversations. You can assign a Label to a Conversation from the side panel.

Labels are tied to the account and can be used to create custom workflows in your organization. You can assign custom colors to a Label. This makes it easier to identify the Label. You will be able to display the Label on the sidebar to filter Conversations quickly.

Click on the sidebar **Settings** on the Live Agent Dashboard.
