# Inviting your agents

For attending incoming chats, it is good to have several agents for distributing and handling them. From the main screen, clicking **Settings**, the **Agents** section will be displayed. From here, new agents can be added by clicking on the green right top button **Add Agent**.

???+ info "Creating teams"
    Head over to [**Teams**](/live-agent/teams) for knowing how to group the agents in teams.

Repeat this process for all your agents. Once finished, you can continue to the chapter [Configuring a Cognigy.AI Endpoint for Handover](/live-agent/getting-started/configuring-a-cognigy-endpoint-for-handover).
