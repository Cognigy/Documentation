# Teams

Teams are organized groups of human Agents' based on their responsibilities. A user can be part of multiple teams. You can assign conversations to a team when you are working collaboratively.

## Create a Team

To create a team within Live Agent, do the following:

1. Open the Live Agent interface.
2. Go to **Settings > Teams**.
3. In the upper-right corner, click **Create new team**.
4. In the **Create a new team** window, fill in the following fields:
    - **Team name** — enter a meaningful name of the team, that associates with its responsibilities, for example, 'Team Customer Support'.
    - **Team Description** — enter a short description about this team. 
5. If you want to allow **auto assign** for the team you create, you can leave the checkbox activated, otherwise untick the checkbox by a mouseclick. If this option is not activated, the conversations remain unassigned and you need to assign them manually. More information see [Assign a Team to a conversation](#assign-a-team-to-a-conversation).
6. Click **Create team**.
7. On the **Add agents to team** page add available Agents you want to your newly created team. This lets you collaborate as a team on conversations, and get notified on new events in the same conversation.
If you want, you can also optionally select all available agents at once for the new team by checking the box next to **AGENT**.
8. Click **Add agents** to confirm your selection.
9. Click **Finish**. The new team will be added and displayed on the **Teams** page.



## Edit a Team

To edit a team within Live Agent to a conversation, do the following:

1. Go to Live Agent.
2. On the left side of the screen, select **Settings**.
3. In the settings column, select **Teams**.
4. On the **Teams** page, to the right of the team you want to change, click **Edit**. 
5. In the **Edit your team** window, update the fields as needed.
6. Click **Update team**.

The team fields and settings will be updated.

## Delete a Team

To delete a team within Live Agent, do the following:

1. Go to Live Agent.
2. On the left side of the screen, select **Settings**.
3. In the settings column, select **Teams**.
4. On the **Teams** page, to the right of the team you want to delete, click **Delete**.
5. You are prompted to enter the team name you want to delete, e.g. 'Team Customer Support', then click **Delete Team Customer Support** to confirm.

Deleting the team will remove the team assignment from the conversations assigned to this team.

## Assign a Team to a conversation

To assign a team to a conversation within Live Agent, you can use a **manual** and an **automatic** routing mode.
All added Agents will be notified when a conversation is assigned to their team.
Go to [Conversation Routing overview](./../conversation/conversation-routing/overview.md) describing routing mode options and how to set a conversation limit per Agent.
