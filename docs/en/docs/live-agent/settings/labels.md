# Labels

_Labels_ help you to categorize and prioritize conversations.

They can be used to create custom workflows, to make conversations easier to identify, filter, and organize. 

Only Administrators and Supervisors can create, edit, and delete Labels.

### Create a Label

To create a Label within Live Agent, do the following:

1. Go to Live Agent.
2. On the left side of the screen, select **Settings**.
3. In the settings column, select **Labels**.
4. At the top right of the window, click **Add label**.
5. In the **Add label** window, do the following, fill in the following fields:
    - Label Name - A name for the Label to identify its category. Only letters, numbers, hyphens and underscores are allowed. For example, `Premium_Customer`.        
    - Description - A brief explanation of the Label's meaning. For example, `This issue needs to be handled with priority`.  
    - Level - A level of access to objects where the Label is applicable. Select one of the following levels: 
        - Global - The Label is available for all Team and Inboxes. 
        - Team - The Label is available only for a specific Team. Select a Team from the **Team** list. Note that you cannot select multiple Teams.
        - Inbox - The Label is available only for a specific Inbox. Select an Inbox from the **Inbox** list. Note that you cannot select multiple Inboxes.
    - Color - A color for the Label to make it visually identifiable. Select your desired color, click the small square again to confirm your selection.
    - Show Label on Sidebar - The option determines whether a Label will be displayed on the sidebar. By using the Label on the sidebar, you can filter conversations.
6. Click **Create**.

The Label will be created and appear under Labels, and will be available to add to Conversations.


!!! tip
    It is good practice to give meaningful names to Labels, and to use chosen colors to easily identify visually which categories, or topics, a conversation belongs to.
