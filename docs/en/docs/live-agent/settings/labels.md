# Labels

_Labels_ help you to categorize and prioritize conversations.

Only Administrators and Supervisors can create, edit, and delete Labels.

1. Go to Live Agent.

3. In the settings column, select **Labels**.
4. At the top right of the window, click **Add label**.
5. In the opened window, provide a Label Name, Description, Level, Inbox, and Color. the file you want to upload and click **Open**.
6. Click **Create**.

The Label will be created and appear under Labels, and will be available to add to Conversations.
