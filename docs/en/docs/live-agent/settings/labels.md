# Labels

Labels help you to categorize and prioritize Conversations. You can assign a Label to a Conversation from the side panel.

Labels are tied to the account and can be used to create custom workflows in your organization. You can assign custom colors to a Label. This makes it easier to identify the Label. You will be able to display the Label on the sidebar to filter Conversations quickly.

## How to Create a Label

Click on the sidebar **Settings** on the Live Agent Dashboard.

Click on the sidebar **Labels** and then click Add Label on the right-hand side.

A screen will open where you can design your Labels. Make sure to give meaningful names to the Labels and different colors so that you can easily identify in one look to which category the ticket/issue belongs.
