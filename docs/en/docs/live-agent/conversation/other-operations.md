## Enable Agent Masking in a chat

When the end user should not see a name and an image of the human agent in the chat the **Agent masking** option can be enabled in the Account Settings by your administrator.
Activating the **Enable Agent masking** setting masks all Agents personal information, such as name, email, and profile images. For example, the Agent name "Max Mustermann" would turn into "Agent x4gH5tZ". Only the Agent himself can see the clear name himself. No one in your organization and of course, no customer can connect the arbitrary masked name with a real human Agent's name.

For more information, read the [Account Settings](../settings/account-settings.md) documentation.
