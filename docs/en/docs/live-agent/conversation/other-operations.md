# Other Operations

In Live Agent, you can mute or unmute, send transcripts via email, clear chat history, and enable agent masking. These actions make managing conversations more efficient, organized, and user-friendly.

## Mute a Conversation

To mute a conversation, do the following:

1. Open the Live Agent interface.
2. On the left-side menu, select **Conversations**.
3. In the **Inboxes** column, select an Inbox. 
4. Select a conversation. 
5. In the upper-right corner of the Conversation page, click ![mute conversation](../../assets/icons/mute-conversation.svg). 

No audio messages can then be sent or received in this chat.

## Unmute a Conversation

1. Open the Live Agent interface.
2. On the left-side menu, select **Conversations**.
3. In the **Inboxes** column, select an Inbox.
4. Select a conversation.
5. In the upper-right corner of the Conversation page, click ![unmute conversation](../../assets/icons/unmute-conversation.svg).

## Send a Conversation Transcript by Email

To send a copy of the current conversation by email, do the following:

1. Open the Live Agent interface.
2. On the left-side menu, select **Conversations**.
3. In the **Inboxes** column, select an Inbox.
4. Select a conversation.
5. In the upper-right corner of the Conversation page, click ![send transcript](../../assets/icons/send-transcript.svg). A screen opens up which allows sending a conversation transcript as email to human agents in a team. The chat transcript can also be sent to the customer or another selected email address.
6. Select your desired option and click **Submit**. 

7. A message will be displayed `The chat transcript was sent successfully`. The chosen recipient will receive the chat transcript in his email inbox.

## Clear Conversation History

To clear a chat history, the `Administrator` or `Supervisor` role is required.

To send a copy of the current conversation by email, do the following:

1. Open the Live Agent interface.
2. On the left-side menu, select **Conversations**.
3. In the **Inboxes** column, select an Inbox.
4. Select a conversation.
5. In the upper-right corner of the Conversation page, click ![clear conversation history](../../assets/icons/clear-conversation-history.svg).

The current selected conversation history will be deleted.

## Enable Agent Masking in a Conversation

When the end user should not see the name and image of the human agent in the chat, the **Agent masking** option can be enabled in the Account Settings by your administrator. 

Activating the **Enable Agent masking** setting masks all agent's personal information, such as name, email, and profile images. For example, the agent name **Max Mustermann** would turn into **Agent x4gH5tZ**. Only the agent himself can see the clear name.
Only the agent can see the original name, so there's no way for anyone else in your organization or the end user to link the masked name to a real human agent.

For more information, read the [Account Settings](../settings/account-settings.md) documentation.
