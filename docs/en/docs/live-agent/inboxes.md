# Inboxes

An Inbox shows the connection of Cognigy.AI to Live Agent. You can have unlimited Inboxes in your Live Agent account. Also, there are some settings you can change in already existing Inboxes.

To access the Inboxes, navigate to the left-side menu of Live Agent and click **Settings**, then select **Inboxes**.
