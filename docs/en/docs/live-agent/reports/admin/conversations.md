# Conversations Report

This report shows a detailed overview of conversation metrics within an account. 

The report lets you easily track trends, such as increases or decreases in the number of conversations, both incoming and outgoing messages, the average response time from agents, the average resolution time for user issues, and the number of successfully resolved user requests.

To learn more about metrics, read [Report Metrics](overview.md#report-metrics).

You can filter a conversation using a time period fileter. The time period considered in the measurement, you can select in the upper drop-down list.

For example, if **last 7 days** is selected, which is the default, the calculation period extends backward from now for seven days.
