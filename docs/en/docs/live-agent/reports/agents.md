# Agents Report

Agents are members of your Customer Support team. Agents will be able to view and reply to messages from your customers.

To generate a report, do the following:

1. Go to Live Agent.
2. In the upper-left corner, click **Reports**.
3. On the upper-left side, click **Agents**.
4. On the upper-left side of the report page, select an Agent in the drop-down list.
5. On the upper-left side of the report page, select a time span in another drop-down list. 

The chart will be updated with the corresponding data related to the selected Agent and time span.

A report can be generated for various [time spans](overview.md) using the drop-down list. By default, time span is set for the last seven days.
