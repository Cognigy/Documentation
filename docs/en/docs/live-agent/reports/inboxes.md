# Inboxes Report

Inboxes are workspaces where Agents handle real-time chat interactions with customers and manage related tasks. You can have unlimited Inboxes in your Live Agent account and you can see conversations specific to an inbox.

To generate a report, do the following:

1. Go to Live Agent.
2. In the upper-left corner, click **Reports**.
3. On the upper-left side, click **Inbox**.
4. On the upper-left side of the report page, select an Inbox in the drop-down list.
5. On the upper-left side of the report page, select a time span in another drop-down list. 

The chart will be updated with the corresponding data related to the selected Inbox and time span.

A report can be generated for various [time spans](overview.md) using the drop-down list. By default, time span is set for the last seven days.
