!!! note
    This dashboard is only visible with the [Supervisor Role](../roles.md#supervisor).

This dashboard gives you an overview of all conversations and indicates how many conversations came in within the last 24 hours. 

Furthermore, you will see an overview of the Agent Status and some metrics regarding conversation handling. At the end of the page, you will find the conversation overview and handling separated by Agent. 

To view this dashboard, click on the Overview tab in Reports.

Starting from Cognigy 4.46, you can change the status of any human agent. To do that, go to the Conversations by Agents section and select the agent whose status you want to change. Next, click on the agent's current status to open the agent status window and select a new status. The new status will be applied automatically.
