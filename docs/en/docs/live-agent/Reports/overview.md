# Live Agent Reports

## Overview

The conversation reports which have occurred over time can be viewed in the **Reports** section.
As a supervisor this chart gives you an overview of all conversations related to a specific Inbox and indicates how many conversations came in within the last 24 hours. 
Furthermore, you will see an overview of the **Agent Status** and some metrics regarding **Conversation Handling**. At the end of the page, you will find a list of handling "Conversations by Agents". 

To see a report, do the following:

1. Go to Live Agent.
2. In the upper-left corner, click **Reports**.

Related to your permission role following reports will be provided:

- [Conversations](conversations.md)
- [Agents](agents.md)
- [Labels](labels.md)
- [Inboxes](inboxes.md)
- [Teams](teams.md)

Supervisors have extended access to a separate overview report: 

- [Supervisor Overview](supervisor-overview.md)

!!! note
    Only users with **Admin** and **Supervisor** roles have access to these reports [User Roles](../roles.md).

Every report includes following indicator values:

- Conversations
- Incoming Messages
- Outgoing Messages
- First Response time
- Resolution Time
- Resolution Count

Every indicator value will be visualized and displayed in a bar chart below. You can define a time span and select an indicator to be visualized in a bar chart for that time span.  

On the top left side of the report page you can open a drop-down menu to select a time span. Alternatively you can define an individual period using a calender-date picker. 
The indicator values presents real-time data that refreshes when new data come in or at page load.
