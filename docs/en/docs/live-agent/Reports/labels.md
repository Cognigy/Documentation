# Labels Report

Labels are tags that help you to categorize and prioritize conversations, providing additional context and information about the content or status of each conversation. You can mark conversations with lables for easy retrieval and sorting in a research.

To generate a report, do the following:

1. Go to Live Agent.
2. In the upper-left corner, click **Reports**.
3. On the upper-left side, click **Labels**.
4. On the upper-left side of the report page, select a label in the drop-down list.
5. On the upper-left side of the report page, select a time span in another drop-down list. 

The chart will be updated with the corresponding data related to the selected label and time span.

A report can be generated for various [time spans](overview.md) using the the drop-down list. By default, time span is set for the last seven days.
