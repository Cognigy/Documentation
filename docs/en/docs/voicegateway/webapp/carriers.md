# Voice Gateway Web App - Carriers

The **Carriers** page allows you to connect your SIP Trunk with Voice Gateway. There are two options on how the SIP Trunk can be added. One is the manual way, by going through the form and filling out all the fields. The second way is by clicking on the _Select from list_ option and selecting one of the pre-configured carriers. This will pre-fill all the fields with standard values.
