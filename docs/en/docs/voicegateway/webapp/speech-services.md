# Speech Services

*Speech Services* allow adding multiple Speech Vendors to the Voice Gateway. 

To create a speech service, in the left-side menu, select Applications, then click **Add speech service** or **+**. Select available speech service providers from the list. Get credentials from your provider and add them to the speech service provider settings.

You can create more than a speech service.

After creating a speech service, you can edit or delete it.
