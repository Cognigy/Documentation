# Speech Services

*Speech Services* allow adding multiple Speech Vendors to the Voice Gateway. 

To create a speech service, in the left-side menu, select Applications, then click **Add speech service** or **+**. Select available speech service providers from the list. Get credentials from your provider and add them to the speech service provider settings.

You can create more than one speech service.

After creating a speech service, you can edit or delete it.

!!! warning
    The user with an Account scope can only edit speech services created by themselves, but they can still use and view speech services shared by Speech providers or Admins.
