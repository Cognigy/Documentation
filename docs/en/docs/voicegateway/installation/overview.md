# Overview

This document is the official installation and operations document for Voice Gateway. It is meant to be used by system administrators and operations engineers who are responsible for setting up Voice Gateway installations and who maintain the operational stability of our software product. It also provides documentation on how to monitor an installation, detect anomalies and ensure that the product delivers high performance and stability even under high load scenarios.

Voice Gateway is a highly scalable software product based on a modern microservices-based software architecture which runs on top of Kubernetes clusters. Before proceeding with the installation, make sure **you are confident with standard Kubernetes administration and operation tasks**. You can get more information in [Kubernetes official documentation](https://kubernetes.io/)
