# xApp Overlay

[![Version badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Added in-v4.75-blue.svg)](../../../release-notes/4.75.md)

By default, an xApp page opens in a separate browser tab.
If you are using Webchat v3,
you can override this behavior to open your xApp pages directly within the Webchat v3 interface.
The pages will be presented in the format of screens.

To configure this behavior for pages with HTML and Adaptive Cards, use the following Nodes:

- [xApp: Show HTML](../../nodes/xApp/set-html-xApp-state.md)
- [xApp: Show Adaptive Card](../../nodes/xApp/set-html-xApp-state.md)
