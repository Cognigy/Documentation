# Use Cases

The xApps can be used in two different ways:

- [As a 2nd screen solution](#2nd-screen)
- [As a standalone solution](#standalone)

## 2nd screen

You can use an xApp in addition to the main communication channels such as voice, webchat widget, Teams, WhatsApp, and others. The full list is provided in [Supported Channels](supported-browsers-and-channels.md#supported-channels).

### Power up virtual agents

Enhance the capabilities of virtual agents by supporting use cases that go beyond the limitations of the current communication channel. This allows virtual agents to handle more complex tasks and provide better assistance to users.

### Power up human agents

Enable Agent Assist to suggest xApps to human agents. These xApps can be shared with users to simplify tasks like form completion or perform actions that the agent cannot handle alone, such as fingerprint authentication or collecting payments.

## Standalone

You can use an xApp as a standalone application. The xApp can be built to address specific tasks or processes that don't require a conversation. These xApps can be accessed via a URL, allowing users to interact with them directly without the need for another communication channel.

## Examples

The examples illustrate specific use cases where an xApp can provide convenient and efficient solutions, enhancing user experiences and improving process workflows.

### Authentication via Credentials

With xApps, you can allow users to authenticate using various methods such as email addresses, user numbers, or other identification details.

Users can securely verify their identity and gain access to specific services or information.
