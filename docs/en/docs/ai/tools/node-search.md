In order to search the flow nodes:

1. Click the **Search Icon** located among the other tools at the bottom left corner of the Chart Editor.
2. An input filed with a placeholder *Search Nodes* opens up, where you can enter the search text.
3. Alternatively, you can also open the search nodes input field by using **Ctrl + Alt + F** or **Command + Option + F** hotkeys.

Once the search text is entered, all the nodes that contain the search text will be highlighted in yellow and the page will automatically be scrolled to the first matching node. Using the *up* and *down* arrows within the search field, one can scroll to the previous and next matching nodes, respectively. In addition, the total number of nodes that contain the search text will also be displayed within the search field. If you like to reset and clear the search text, click the *Clear Input* button in the search field.

???+ info "Tip: Toggle Search Icon"
    In order to close the search nodes input field without resetting the search text, click on the *Search Icon* in the chart editor toolbar again. Doing this toggles the node highlighting.

Futher, when a highlighted node is opened, the field that has the match will have its label highlighted.
