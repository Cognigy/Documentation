## 4.33.1
**Released** September 7th, 2022

**Important announcement**:

With release v4.30.0 we have officially marked our [kubernetes](https://github.com/cognigy/kubernetes) repository as `deprecated`. If you are an `on-premise` customer and you are running Cognigy.AI/Cognigy Insights yourself, please have a look at our [Helm Chart](https://github.com/cognigy/cognigy-ai-helm-chart) which we have crafted for Cognigy.AI/Cognigy Insights! Our Kubernetes repository will still receive updates `until 31st December 2022`.

### Improvements
- Improved by storing response data from Salesforce into the Input object after starting a Handover

### Bugfixes
- Fixed a bug where the ChatRequestFailed event from Salesforce would cause the Handover status to be set to "completed" instead of "error"
- Fixed a bug where context updates during agentInject where lost when the Handover was finished
