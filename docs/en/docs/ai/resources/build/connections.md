# Connections

Connections are encrypted credentials that can be used with [Extensions]({{config.site_url}}ai/resources/manage/extensions/). The Connections view can be used to update and delete existing Connections. New Connections are created directly within the [Extension]({{config.site_url}}ai/resources/manage/extensions/) Nodes that use them.
