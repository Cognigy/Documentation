# Build

The Build section allows for the creation of resources that help shape your Virtual Agent. 

## Flows

The **Flow** is an important (and powerful) concept within Cognigy.AI. It provides a **visual representation of a potential dialog** using a user-friendly flow chart. Flows are composed of indivual **Nodes** with different functionalities, ranging from generating output to collecting back-end information.

    Head over to [**Flows**]({{config.site_url}}ai/resources/build/flows/) for more information.

## Lexicons

**Lexicons **are collections of **domain-specific Keyphrases** (also known as **Entities**) that can be attached to a **Flow**. A **Lexicon **can be seen as a dictionary, that allows the **Virtual Agent** to "understand" specific words, like car brands, product groups or zipcodes.

## Connections
Connections are encrypted credentials that can be used with [**Extensions**]({{config.site_url}}ai/resources/build/connections/) . The Connections view can be used to update and delete existing Connections. New Connections are created directly within the Extension Nodes that use them.

## NLU Connectors
NLU Connectors can be used to connect to third-party NLU engines, like Google Dialogflow and IBM Watson.
