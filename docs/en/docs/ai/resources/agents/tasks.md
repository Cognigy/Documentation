# Tasks

_Tasks_ are specific activities, such as training Intents, importing Snapshots, or creating a new Agent. A Task is an asynchronous process that can run in the background and is associated with the notification system.

## Task Panel

The Task Panel provides an overview of both current and previous tasks, serving as a high-level change log for relevant activities. It is accessible by clicking the Task icon located at the top-right of the screen.

The Task Panel displays both ongoing and finished tasks.

## Notifications

After a task is completed, in the upper-right corner of the Cognigy.AI interface, you will receive one of the following notifications:

- **Success Notification**. This notification is displayed when a task is successfully completed.
- **Error Notification**. This notification is displayed when a task encounters an error and fails. The notification provides a description of the issue.
