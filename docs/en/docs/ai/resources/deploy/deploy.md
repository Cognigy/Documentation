## Endpoints
<div class="divider"></div>

Virtual Agents need to be deployed to channels in order for them to be available to the general audience. This process uses so-called Endpoints.

Head over to [Endpoints](../../endpoints/overview.md) for more information.

## Snapshots

Snapshots allow for the bundling of resources into a single package. This is very useful when working with different Agent versions.

Head over to [Snapshots](snapshots.md) for more information.
