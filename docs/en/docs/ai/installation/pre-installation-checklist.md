# Pre-installation Checklist

Before proceeding with your on-prem installation with or without installation support from Cognigy side, make sure the criteria from the following checklist are met:

1. Read through the installation instructions in `README.md` files in both helm charts ([MongoDB](https://github.com/Cognigy/cognigy-mongodb-helm-chart) and [Cognigy.AI](https://github.com/Cognigy/cognigy-ai-helm-chart)) in advance and complete necessary preparations.

2. Prerequisites for MongoDB Helm Chart installation are met (see `README.md` file in [MongoDB Helm Chart](https://github.com/Cognigy/cognigy-mongodb-helm-chart) for details).

3. Prerequisites for Cognigy.AI Helm Chart installation are met (see `README.md` file in [Cognigy.AI Helm Chart](https://github.com/Cognigy/cognigy-ai-helm-chart) for details).

4. Configuration sections for both Helm charts are accomplished and `values.yaml` files for both charts are prepared and prepopulated with necessary data (see README.md files in MongoDB and Cognigy.AI Helm Charts for details).

5. Team has access to the kubernetes cluster via `kubectl`.

6. `kubectl` and `helm` utilities are installed with **required versions**.

7. Kubernetes cluster has enough resources: at least 6 x worker nodes (8 CPU, 16 GB RAM, `x86_64` architecture, 100 GB root SSD storage).
