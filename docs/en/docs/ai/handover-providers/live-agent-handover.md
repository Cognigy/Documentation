## Description

<div class="divider"></div>

Live Agent is Cognigy handover provider, allowing human agents to take over escalated conversations from virtual agents.

Tight integration with Cognigy.AI that goes far beyond the integration we have with other handover services:

- Experience an easy, seamless setup of a Live Agent Inbox for a Cognigy.AI Project
    
- Configuration of the handover with just a few clicks

- AI Copilot: Support of human agents by virtual agents
    
- Enhance the capabilities of the virtual agent, based on outputs of human agents

Projects and Inboxes within Live Agent are easily setup, and Agents can be added and managed with ease.
