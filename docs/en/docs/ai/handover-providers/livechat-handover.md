# LiveChat (legacy)
## Description
<div class="divider"></div>
LiveChat is Cognigy's legacy handover provider, allowing human agents to take over escalated conversations from virtual agents. 

If Cognigy LiveChat is configured for your Cognigy.AI environment, everything is pre-configured and the only thing you need to do is selecting **Cognigy LiveChat** as your Handover Provider in the **Handover Settings** of your Endpoint.

## Live Agent

    You can access our early documentation to setup *Live Agent* here.
