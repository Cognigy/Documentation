## Description

<div class="divider"></div>

Cognigy provides **8x8** as an additional handover provider, which can be used to connect users with human agents who use 8x8 as a contact center.

To learn more about handovers, refer to [Agent Handover](overview.md). 

## Setup

<div class="divider"></div>

To start using 8x8 as a handover provider with Cognigy.AI:

1. Go to **Deploy > Endpoints**.
2. Open the Endpoint where you want to enable Handover to 8x8. 
3. Scroll down to **Handover Settings** and select **8x8** from the list.
4. Fill in the following fields:
    - **Base URL** — the URL of the 8x8 Server.
    - **API Key** — the header value required for authenticating API calls to the 8x8 system.
    - **8x8-Tenant** — the Tenant ID, the field is mandatory if a customer has multiple tenants in the organization.
5. Copy the Endpoint URL, as you need it to configure 8x8.
6. Click **Save**.

To continue setup on the 8x8, go to [Configure 8x8](../endpoints/8x8.md#configure-8x8).
