## Description

<div class="divider"></div>

Cognigy provides **8x8** as an additional handover provider, which can be used to connect users with human agents who use 8x8 as a contact center.

To learn more about handovers, refer to [Agent Handover](overview.md). 

## Setup

<div class="divider"></div>

### Create an Endpoint

To start using 8x8 as a handover provider with Cognigy.AI:

1. Go to **Deploy > Endpoints**.
2. Open the Endpoint where you want to enable handover to 8x8. 
3. Scroll down to **Handover Settings** and select **8x8** from the list.
4. Fill in the following fields:
    - **Base URL** — the URL of the 8x8 Server.
    - **API Key** — the header value required for authenticating API calls to the 8x8 system.
    - **8x8-Tenant** — the Tenant ID, the field is mandatory if a customer has multiple tenants in the organization.
5. Copy the Endpoint URL, as you need it to configure 8x8.
6. Click **Save**.

### Configure 8x8

To continue setup, go to the 8x8 configuration:

{! _includes/ai/providers/8x8/8x8-config.md !}

### Configure Handover Settings

In the [Handover to Agent](../tools/agent-handover.md) Node, configure the following settings:

- **8x8 Channel Id** — the 8x8 Channel id that should be used. To get this id, go to the 8x8 Configuration Contact Center (admin panel). In the left-side menu, select **Channels > Chat API**. Select the channel from the list. Copy **Channel ID**. 
- **8x8 Queue Id** — the 8x8 Queue id that should be used. To get this id, go to the 8x8 Configuration Contact Center (admin panel). In the left-side menu, select **Channels > Chat API**. Select the channel from the list. Copy **Queue ID**.     
- **8x8 JSON properties** — the custom JSON with the 8x8 properties. This data will be included in the conversation object and will be available only for a human agent.

To check the handover, go to the installation that your server administrator has deployed.
