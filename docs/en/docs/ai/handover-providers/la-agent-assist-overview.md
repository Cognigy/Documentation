# Agent Assist (Beta)

## Overview

<div class="divider"></div>

**Agent Assist** is our tool which integrates with **Live Agent** to assist real Agents by utilizing the power of Cognigy.AI. 

Agent Assist has the ability to:

- Suggest replies (including media) which can be forwarded to the customer
    
- Provide contextual information for the Agent (CRM records, ERP data, small talk clues, etc.)

- Allow quick access to resources (knowledge DB articles, backend tools, etc.)

Using Cognigy.AI, you can customize Agent Assist to be as powerful as you need it to be.
