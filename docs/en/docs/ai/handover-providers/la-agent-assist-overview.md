## Overview

<div class="divider"></div>

**Agent Assist** allows human agents using **Cognigy Live Agent** to be assisted by AI-powered Virtual Agents when conversing with the customer. Using this functionality, during an active handover, fully configurable Virtual Agent messages can be displayed to the human agent based on customer messages to best assist the customer.

- Provide contextual information for the Agent (CRM records, ERP data, small talk clues, and more)
- Allow quick access to resources such as knowledge base articles
- Suggest replies (including media) which can be forwarded to the customer

Using Cognigy.AI, you can customize Agent Assist to be as powerful as you need it to be.
