## Description

The Match Pattern Node enables a user to find patterns in text and expose them in the [Input Object](../../tools/interaction-panel/input.md).

You can define patterns that will be searched for in the input text or the alternate text that was provided. If a pattern is found, a matchedPatterns group will be created in the [Input Object](../../tools/interaction-panel/input.md).

## Patterns

Patterns can be any text and can contain references to slots by using the `@` symbol. 

Example: `@color @product`

A text like `I need a green shirt` would find the compound slot group and assign `color = green` and `product = shirt`.

### Tags

Slots can be tagged in a pattern to be easier identifiable later.

Example: `from @city>origin to @city>destination`.

A text like `I want to go from DÃ¼sseldorf to Tokyo` would find a matched pattern group with origin and destination set.

## Example

Text: `I want to fly from bErlin to NEW York with 3 or 4 people on October 1st 2021 if its 30 degrees and I am 22 years old 100%`

Pattern: `from @city>origin to @city>destination with @NUMBER>ppl1 or @NUMBER>ppl2 people @DATE>date if its @TEMPERATURE>celsius degrees and I am @AGE>userage years old @PERCENTAGE>perc`

Result:
