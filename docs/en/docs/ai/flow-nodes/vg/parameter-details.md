# Voice Gateway Parameter Details

Cognigy Voice Gateway has many configuration settings that are controlled directly from within your Flow. These settings can be applied individually to the scopes:

- **Setting Session Parameters**. Session parameters can comfortably be set with the [Set Session Config](set-session-config.md) Node. When executed, the settings will apply for the remainder of the session.
- **Setting Activity Parameters**. Activity parameters can be set per activity/node. If, for example, barge-in is set on the [Play](play.md) Node, barge-in will only be activated during the execution of this Node. Therefore, the user can interrupt the virtual agent during this output but not afterward. These configurations are also available in the [Say](../message/say.md), [Question](../message/question.md), and [Optional Question](../message/optional-question.md) Nodes.

| Disable TTS Audio Caching  | Toggle        | Disables TTS audio caching.<br><br> By default, the setting is deactivated. In this case, previously requested TTS audio results are stored in the virtual agent cache. When a new TTS request is made, and the audio text has been previously requested, the virtual agent retrieves the cached result instead of sending another request to the TTS provider.<br><br> When the setting is activated, the virtual agent no longer caches TTS results. In this case, each request is directly sent to your speech provider.  <br><br> Note that disabling caching can increase TTS costs. For detailed information, contact your speech provider. |

| Deepgram Tier                   | Dropdown      | This parameter is active only when Deepgram is selected in the STT Vendor setting. <br><br> Choose a tier for your API request, and ensure that the model is available for the chosen STT language. For detailed information about Deepgram tiers, refer to the [Deepgram documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/tier).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Deepgram Model                  | Dropdown      | This parameter is active only when Deepgram is selected in the STT Vendor setting. <br><br> Choose a model for processing submitted audio. Each model is associated with a tier. Ensure that the selected tier is available for the chosen STT language.  For detailed information about Deepgram models, refer to the [Deepgram documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/model).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Endpointing                     | Toggle        | This parameter is active only when Deepgram is selected in the STT Vendor setting. <br><br> Deepgram's Endpointing feature watches streaming audio for long pauses that signal the end of speech. When it spots an endpoint, it finalizes predictions and returns the transcript, marking it as complete with the `speech_final` parameter set to `true`.  For detailed information about Deepgram Endpointing, refer to the [Deepgram documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/endpointing).<br><br>The duration for detecting the end of speech is preconfigured with a default value (10 milliseconds). If you want to change this value, use the Endpointing Time setting. |
| Endpointing Time                | Number        | This parameter is active only when Deepgram is selected in the STT Vendor setting and the Endpointing toggle is enabled. <br><br> Customize the duration (in milliseconds) for detecting the end of speech. The default is 10 milliseconds of silence. Transcripts are sent after detecting silence, and the system waits until the speaker resumes or the required silence time is reached. Once either condition is met, a transcript is sent back with `speech_final` set to `true`.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Smart Formatting                | Toggle        | This parameter is active only when Deepgram is selected in the STT Vendor setting. <br><br> Deepgram's Smart Format feature applies additional formatting to transcripts to optimize them for human readability. Smart Format capabilities vary between models. When Smart Formatting is turned on, Deepgram will always apply the best-available formatting for your chosen model, tier, and language combination. For detailed examples, refer to the [Deepgram documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/smart-format). <br><br> Note that when Smart Formatting is turned on, punctuation will be activated, even if you have the Disable STT Punctuation setting enabled.  |
| STT Hints                       | Text          | Array of words or phrases to assist speech detection. <br> Note: This requires support from the STT engine. The field is not available for the Nuance speech vendor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Dynamic Hints                   | CognigyScript | Uses context or input for adding array hints. For example, <code>&lcub;&lcub;context.hints&rcub;&rcub;</code> or <code>&lcub;&lcub;input.hints&rcub;&rcub;</code>. You can override these settings using [Advanced parameters](#advanced).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| STT Label                       | CognigyScript | The alternative name of the vendor is the one you [specify in the Voice Gateway Self-Service Portal](../../../voicegateway/webapp/applications.md#add-additional-tts-and-stt-vendor). If you have created multiple speech services from the same vendor, use the label to specify which service to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Google Model                    | Dropdown      | This parameter is active only when Google is selected in the STT Vendor setting.<br><br>Utilizes one of Google Cloud Speech-to-Text transcription models, with the `latest_short` model being the default choice. For a detailed list of Google models, refer to the [Transcription models](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/transcription-model#transcription_models)  section in the Google Documentation. Keep in mind that the `default` value is a Google Model type that can be used if other models don't suit your specific scenario.                                                                                                                                 |
