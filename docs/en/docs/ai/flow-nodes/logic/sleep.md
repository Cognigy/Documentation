## Description
<div class="divider"></div>

A Sleep Node is used to pause the execution of a Flow for a certain time.

If your Flow returns multiple messages at once with much content (e.g. a query Flow), you can use a Sleep Node to set a pause between messages to simulate a more natural human-like response behavior.
