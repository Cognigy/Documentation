# Set AdaptiveCard xApp State

An xApp Page can be built by providing an Adaptive Card in JSON format.

To submit data back to the Flow, you need to include a Submit button within the Adaptive Card as the `adaptivecard` library is configured to take any `submit` payload from the card and forward them through the [xApp SDK](../../xApp/sdk.md). 

## AdaptiveCard Definition

To create an Adaptive Card, use the [constructor](https://adaptivecards.io/designer). Copy JSON from the constructor and paste it into the form.

## Style Overrides

To override colors, use CSS color codes.
