<div class="divider"></div>

Cognigy.AI v4.9.0 provides new functionality that allows our customers to use a new dynamic select field as a new field type in their  [Extensions]({{config.site_url}}ai/resources/manage/extensions/). The feature can be used to dynamically fetch the content of a select field through e.g. an external API call.

## Options Resolver

Using Options Resolver is a way to enhance the seamless integration of a Cognigy Extension with third-party systems by providing dynamically resolved select options for Node Fields.
