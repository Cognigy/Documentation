# NLU Warnings

## Description
<div class="divider"></div>
(new Feature in Cognigy.AI v4.3.0)

Cognigy.AI will now show warning notifications when the system detects issues in Intent-rules, Intent-Conditions as well as generic issues while executing NLU on user-inputs. 

Warnings will only be generated and forwarded to our user interface when the Interaction Panel is used during testing.

### Example: How does the Feature NLU Warnings work

1. Open the Cognigy.AI dashboard and [create a new Flow](https://support.cognigy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360014524180-Design-a-Flow-and-add-a-Message)  for example, named as NLU Warnings

</figure>

2. Open the new Flow and select tab **NLU**
3. Create a new **intent** for example, "int1" and enter more than three example sentences (for example, "Test1"... "Test5")


**For a proper intent scoring it is important to define "Rules" and "Conditions"!** â€”  so we do it

</figure>

4. Go to the **Rules** edit field and enter for example **input.text=="rule"**
5. Go to the **Conditions** edit field and enter for example **input.includes==="condition"**
6. Click on **Build Model** to finish the intent creation 

Now user inputs can be scored of matching to the defined intent example sentences 

7. Open the [Interaction Panel](https://dash.readme.com/project/cognigy/v4.3/docs/interaction-panel) on the right hand side
8. For the scoring test you need to activate in Tab **SETTINGS** the expert mode

Activated Expert mode will show more detailed data on the Interaction panel!

</figure>

Now every input (Text Message) on the Interaction Panel will be evaluated with the defined Rules and Conditions of the created intent. As result a notification will be displayed (see image above) which indicates the intent name and the percentage rating number (1 means 100%).

In case that "Rules" or "Conditions" are not defined correctly (for example, missing relevant code details), a NLU Warning will be displayed on the Interaction Panel which is displayed for 30 seconds (see following image)
