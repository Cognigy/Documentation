# LLM-Based Intent Reranking

[![Version badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Added in-v4.76-blue.svg)](../../../release-notes/4.76.md)

_LLM-based intent reranking_ is a process that uses a Large Language Model (LLM) to reorganize or reorder identified intents based on data taken from the input text. This process involves using a more advanced language model to better understand the context and meaning of the user's input, which improves the accuracy of intent classification.

Cognigy NLU analyzes user input and identifies up to 5 most probable Intents.
The result depends on various factors, including the total number of Intents, example sentences, rejected Intents, thresholds, and language specifics.
Sometimes the correct Intent is returned in the top-5 but not with the highest priority.
Adding an LLM request after the Cognigy NLU mapping process can improve accuracy.

Starting from version 4.76, Cognigy automatically includes descriptions of Intents to the results generated during the mapping process.
These descriptions become a part of the Input object and are stored in the `input.nlu.intentMapperResults.scores[x].description` object for each mapped Intent, where `x` represents the priority of the Intent.
The stored descriptions are sent to an external LLM via a prompt, which can be made via the LLM Prompt Node.
The external LLM analyzes the data and generates a result based on the retrieved descriptions. This result is recorded in the `intent.promptResult` object by default.

Once you have the correct Intent, you can continue the Flow based on this Intent. For example, if a user requested information about a product, you can provide product descriptions, answers to frequently asked questions, and options for placing an order.

## Prerequisites

- Add an [external LLM](../../resources/build/llm.md) that supports the LLM Prompt Node & LLM-powered Answer Extraction features.
- Create a Flow and Intents in it.

## How to Set up

To rerank Intents via an external LLM, follow these steps:

1. [Add descriptions to Intents](#add-descriptions-to-intents)
2. [Add a LLM Prompt Node with the relevant prompt](#add-an-llm-prompt-node)

### Add Descriptions to Intents

To add descriptions to Intents, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cognigy.AI interface.
2. From the left-side menu, select the project where you want to implement LLM-based intent reranking.
3. In the **Project** menu, navigate to **Build > Flows**.
4. On the **Flows** page, select the Flow you want to change.
5. In the upper-right corner, select **NLU**.
6. On the **Intents** tab, locate the Intent to which you want to add a description.
7. On the **Intent** page, in the upper-right corner, click ![vertical-ellipsis](../../../assets/icons/vertical-ellipsis.svg) **> Edit**.
8. In the **Edit Intent** window, go to the **Description** field. Enter a clear and concise description that reflects the content of the example sentences listed in the Intent. Note that the **Description** field can contain no more than 200 characters.
9. Click **Save**.
10. Repeat steps 6-9 for other Intents within the Flow.
11. In the upper-right corner, click **Build Model**.

### Add an LLM Prompt Node

To add an LLM Prompt Node with the relevant prompt, follow these steps:

1. In the Flow editor, add an LLM Prompt Node.
2. In the LLM Prompt Node, go to the **Instruction (System Message/Prompt)** field and enter the following prompt for re-ranking:

    ```text
    Your are an expert in intent recognition. Given a list of intents, their descriptions, and a query, you need to choose the right intent for the query.

    Given the following intents and descriptions:
   
    Intent 1: {{"{{ input.nlu.intentMapperResults.scores[0].name }}"}}
    Description 1: {{"{{ input.nlu.intentMapperResults.scores[0].description }}"}}
   
    Intent 2: {{"{{ input.nlu.intentMapperResults.scores[1].name }}"}}
    Description 2: {{"{{ input.nlu.intentMapperResults.scores[1].description }}"}}
   
    Intent 3: {{"{{ input.nlu.intentMapperResults.scores[2].name }}"}}
    Description 3: {{"{{ input.nlu.intentMapperResults.scores[2].description }}"}}
   
    Intent 4: {{"{{ input.nlu.intentMapperResults.scores[3].name }}"}}
    Description 4: {{"{{ input.nlu.intentMapperResults.scores[3].description }}"}}
   
    Intent 5: {{"{{ input.nlu.intentMapperResults.scores[4].name }}"}}
    Description 5: {{"{{ input.nlu.intentMapperResults.scores[4].description }}"}}
   
    And the following query: {{"{{input.text}}"}}
   
    Choose the correct intent for the query. Output the intent using the JSON format as follows: {"intent": intent_name}
    ```

3. Navigate to the **Advanced** section and configure the recommended parameters as follows:<br>
    3.1 From the **Sampling Method** list, select **Temperature** and set the temperature to `0`.<br>
    3.2 From the **Response Format** list, select **JSON output**.
4. _(Optional)_ If you want the model to return the similar result for the subsequent requests, specify a number in the **Seed** parameter. For example, `123`.
5. Click **Save Node**.

Now you can test your Flow via the Interaction Panel.

## Example

In this example, a user wants to order pizza and shares their preferences. The virtual agent recognizes if the user has ingredient restrictions and determines the correct Intent.

Let's assume that we have the following Intent data:

| Intent Name      | Intent Description                                                                                                                                                                                    | Sentences                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

Consider the example of Intent reranking based on the following user input:

```text
I'd like something low-calorie, but here's the catch â€” I don't eat any animal products, 
and I'm allergic to milk-based ingredients.
```

### Cognigy NLU

After applying Cognigy NLU Intent mapping, `Fallback Reject Intent`
is assigned priority `1` with a score of `0.588120879379653`, instead of the correct Intent `Veggie Pizza`,
which has priority `3` with a score of `0.026957729768803257`.

```json
{
  "nlu": {
    "intentMapperResults": {
      "scores": [
        {
          "id": null,
          "name": "null - Fallback Reject Intent",
          "score": 0.588120879379653,
          "negated": false,
          "confirmationSentence": null,
          "confirmationSentences": null,
          "disambiguationSentence": null,
          "flow": null,
          "description": ""
        },
        {
          "id": "8f44b7b1-d984-4da3-9558-6c128a190235",
          "name": "Vegetarian Pizza",
          "score": 0.2909909269629138,

          "disambiguationSentence": null,
          "flow": "f212ad29-e38e-4cfc-bc1c-47b12cfd9fc3",
          "description": "Intent for ordering a meatless pizza. It contains milk-based products and vegetables. Often has cheese as a main ingredient, such as mozzarella, cheddar, feta, or goat cheese. Good for vegetarians."
        },
        {
          "id": "a9418c1b-f956-402b-b317-cabe91950946",
          "name": "Veggie Pizza",
          "score": 0.026957729768803257,
          "negated": false,

          "flow": "f212ad29-e38e-4cfc-bc1c-47b12cfd9fc3",
          "description": "Intent for ordering a pizza with only vegetable toppings such as tomatoes, mushrooms, bell peppers, onions, olives, spinach, and broccoli. A light and refreshing option for health-conscious eaters."
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, to view up to 5 probable results, you can output them via a [Say](../../nodes/basic/say.md) Node by including the [prompt](#add-an-llm-prompt-node) in the **Text** field.

### Cognigy NLU + External LLM

After applying the Cognigy NLU Intent mapping and external LLM reranking, the correct Intent `Veggie Pizza` is identified.

```json
{
   "promptResult": "Based on the user query \"I'd like something low-calorie, but here's the catchâ€”I don't eat any animal products, and I'm allergic to milk-based ingredients.\", the correct intent for this query is \"Veggie Pizza\".\n\nOutput:\n{\"intent\": \"Veggie Pizza\"}",
}
```

Once the virtual agent identifies the correct Intent, you can continue the Flow.
For example, the virtual agent can offer pizza options from the identified category `Veggie Pizza`.
