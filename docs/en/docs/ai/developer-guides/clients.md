# Clients

Cognigy offers a variety of clients in various languages to connect with Cognigy.AI. All of these are hosted on [Cognigy's GitHub account](https://github.com/Cognigy). 

All clients except the REST API Client connect against Cognigy Endpoints. The REST API Client connects directly against the Cognigy API and can be used to interface with Cognigy Resources directly from TypeScript/JavaScript.
