Within our **Cognigy.AI** platform you're able to connect your Cognigy resources to your **Google Actions** app by using our Google Actions Endpoint integration.

## Generic Endpoint Settings

- [Data Protection & Analytics]({{config.site_url}}ai/endpoints/data-protection-and-analytics/)
- [Transformer Functions]({{config.site_url}}ai/endpoints/transformers/transformers/) 
- [NLU Connectors]({{config.site_url}}ai/resources/build/nlu-connectors/)

Google actions only requires the **endpoint URL** from the Cognigy.AI endpoint, therefore there are no channel specific configuration settings required.
