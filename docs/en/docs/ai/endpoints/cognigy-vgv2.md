Within our **COGNIGY.AI** platform you are able to connect your **Agent** to your Contact Center or other phone numbers using our **Voice Gateway**, allowing customers to speak with your **Agent** instead of just writing to it.

## Voice Gateway specific Nodes

Cognigy.AI comes with built in Nodes to control Voice Gateway. See [Voice Gateway Nodes]({{config.site_url}}ai/flow-nodes/vgv2/voice-gateway/) for more information.
