The Cognigy Webchat is a powerful Tool for customers that want to implement a conversational AI into their own Websites or want to showcase a Bot for quick Demonstrations.

The Webchat can be used free of additional charges when used with Cognigy and is available for [Download on GitHub](https://github.com/Cognigy/WebchatWidget/releases/latest).

## Features

In addition to sending and receiving regular text messages, the Webchat can also present content and provide interactive inputs in various ways to improve the user experience. Read more about that in our [Webchat Features]({{config.site_url}}ai/endpoints/webchat/webchat-features) documentation.

**Embedding using GitHub instructions** 

<blockquote class="callout callout_info" theme="ðŸ“˜">
   <h3 class="callout-heading false">
      <p>
         <a href="https://github.com/Cognigy/WebchatWidget/blob/master/docs/README.md" target="_blank" >Cognigy/WebchatWidget"</a>
      </p>
   </h3>

When you have set up a Webchat Endpoint in Cognigy, you can follow the [embedding instructions on GitHub](https://github.com/Cognigy/WebchatWidget/blob/master/docs/embedding.md) to see how you can implement the Webchat within your Website.

It also features an expressive [technical documentation](https://github.com/Cognigy/WebchatWidget/tree/master/docs) with examples for integrators, which can help you build a seamless and powerful integration into your Website.


**Embedding HTML Code available in Endpoint Editor**

As of release v4.8x Cognigy.AI adds a form section to the Webchat Endpoint configuration to provide embedding-ready code to users.
Clicking the link "**Open Embedding Documentation**" below the embed field takes you to the [GitHub Webchat Widget embedding documentation](https://github.com/Cognigy/WebchatWidget/blob/master/docs/embedding.md) for detailed specifications and examples.

When hovering over the code field you will get a button displayed to copy the code to the clipboard. 

That makes your Webchat configuration for your own purposes much easier now.
