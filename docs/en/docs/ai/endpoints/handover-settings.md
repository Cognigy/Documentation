# Handover Settings

Cognigy.AI supports integrating with various `Live Agent Tools`, so that a user can be transferred to an agent at any point during the conversation by using a [Handover Node](doc:live-chat) in the Flow.

## Channel Support

Supported Endpoints have a configuration tab called `Handover Settings`. In there, the `Handover Platform` that the user should be forwarded to when a Handover Node is triggered is selected and configured. Cognigy.AI currently has native support with the following Handover Platforms:

- Cognigy.AI Livechat
- [RingCentral Engage](https://www.ringcentral.com/digital-customer-engagement.html)
- [Chatwoot integration](doc:chatwoot-integration), new in Cognigy.AI v4.3.0
