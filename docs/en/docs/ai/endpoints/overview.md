# Overview

Endpoints are the connector between your user interface and the Cognigy Agent.
This connection can range from text-based conversation to a conversation on your contact center phone-lines.

## Features

<div class="divider"></div>

Every Endpoint has the following features: 

- it points to a single Locale of a single Flow of a single Snapshot
- it can be disabled
- customization of the [Data Protection & Analytics](data-protection-and-analytics.md) 
- it can have its own [Transformer Function](transformers/transformers.md)

Selected Endpoints also have the option to customize the NLU that provides the Intent and Slot mapping for the agent.

The [NLU Connectors](../resources/build/nlu-connectors.md) that are configured to the agent are available to select from this dropdown menu. Alternatively, the [No NLU](../nlu/external-nlu/no-nlu.md) option can be selected to completely disable the intent and slot mapping for an endpoint. 

Additionally, there are Endpoint-specific features and configuration options available.
