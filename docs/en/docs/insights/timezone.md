# Timezone

Insights presents time-based data with an account to the user's timezone. 

!!! note
    In OData feed time is always in UTC format. You should take this into account if
you compare timezones with Insights.


## Changing preferred Timezone

By default, Insights uses timezone preferences of your device. 

You can override this in **My Profile**. 

This comes handy if you travel a lot and your device timezone gets updated by your location, 
or you may have a multinational Agent with the users all over the globe.

To change timezone preferences:

1. Go to Cognigy.AI.
2. In the upper-right corner, select **User Menu > My Profile**.
3. In the **Preferences** section, select timezone from the list.


!!! note
    Custom Timezone preferences are stored inside the browser storage, means you need to select custom timezone preference again if you change the device and/or the browser.
