# Timezone

## Timezone support

<div class="divider"></div>

Insights applications support presenting time-based data with an account to the user's timezone. 

---
**Note**

In OData feed time is always in UTC format. You should take this into account if
you compare it with Insights.

## Changing preferred Timezone

By default, **we use timezone preferences of your device**. You can override this  in "My Profile". 

This comes handy if you travel a lot and your device timezone gets updated by your location or you may have a multi-national Agent with the users all over the globe.

To change timezone preferences:

- Click on the user icon on the top-right corner.
- Select "My Profile".

<figure>
  <img class="image-center" src="{{config.site_url}}insights/images/user-menu-my-profile.png" width="50%" alt="User menu with 'My profile' option" />
  <figcaption>User menu with "My profile" option</figcaption>
</figure>

- Choose prefered timezone in the "Select Timezone" input.

<figure>
  <img class="image-center" src="{{config.site_url}}insights/images/my-profile-timezone-selection.png" width="100%" alt="Excerpt of the settings on 'My Profile page'" />
  <figcaption>Here selected the "Europe/Berlin" timezone</figcaption>
</figure>

**Note**

Custom Timezone preferences are stored inside the browser storage, means you need to select custom timezone preference again if you change the device and/or the browser.
