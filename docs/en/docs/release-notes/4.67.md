### Infrastructure

#### Cognigy Voice Gateway

- Updated the `helm.sh/hook` annotations for the following `Secret` resources to `"helm.sh/hook": "pre-install,pre-upgrade"`:
    - voicegateway-call-recording-credentials
    - voicegateway-drachtio-secret
    - voicegateway-jwt
    - voicegateway-mysql-password
- Remove unused `replicaCount` from `spec.Values` for:
    - rtpEngine
    - rtpEngineSidecar
    - sbcSipSidecar
- With the release of 4.65.0, we introduced `StatefulSets` for `sbc-sip` and `sbc-rtp`. We recommend enabling `StatefulMode` as it improves the load balancing of traffic between the replicas.
    - The required changes in values.yaml:
        - `spec.Values.sbc.sip.useStatefulSet: true`
        - `spec.Values.sbc.rtp.useStatefulSet: true`
    ```yaml
    sbc:
    sip:      
      useStatefulSet: true
    rtp:      
      useStatefulSet: true
    ```
- With the release of 4.65.0, we introduced Redis High Availability. We recommend enabling `redisHa`:
    - The required changes in values.yaml:
    ```yaml
    cognigyEnv:
    FEATURE_REDIS_SENTINEL_MODE_ENABLED: "true"
    REDIS_SENTINEL_MASTER_NAME: "mymaster"
    REDIS_SENTINEL_HOST: "redis-ha-headless"
    REDIS_SENTINEL_PORT: "26379"
      
    redisHa:
    enabled: true
    metrics:
    serviceMonitor:
    enabled: true
    ```
- With the release of 4.64.0, we disabled Grafana via a feature flag since we are using `cognigy-monitoring-stack`, which already includes Grafana. In the current release, we are removing all Grafana-related resources from the Helm charts:
    - Service: `grafana/service.yaml`
      - Deployment: `grafana/deployment.yaml`
      - ConfigMap: `grafana/config-map.yaml`
      - StorageClasses:
          - `templates/gcp/grafana/storage-class.yaml`
          - `templates/azure/grafana/storage-class.yaml`
          - `templates/aws/grafana/storage-class.yaml`
