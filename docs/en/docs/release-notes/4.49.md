# 4.49

!!! warning "Migration to MongoDB 5"
    Starting from [v4.48](4.48.md),  Cognigy.AI and Cognigy Insights fully support MongoDB 5. Since our first release in July, we will no longer support MongoDB 4.4 and earlier versions.

## 4.49.1

### Cognigy Insights

**Released** April 21st, 2023

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed the issue where referenceEndpointId was missing the ODATA Sessions collection

## 4.49.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** April 18th, 2023

#### Improvements

- Added the OAuth2 authentication method to the [Send SMTP Email](../ai/flow-nodes/message/send-smtp-email.md#authentication) and [Email Notification](../ai/flow-nodes/message/send-email-notification.md#authentication) Nodes
- Added OAuth2 authentication support for the email notifications: password reset, multi-org user login, and organization deletion
- Improved Demo Webchat by adding support for both `user` and `userId` query strings
- Added the functionality to display the name of any conflicting resource during package import
- Made the [security improvement](../ai/tools/user-menu/my-profile.md#api-keys) by displaying API keys only once during creation and storing their hashes
- Improved by allowing v2.0 routes for Package APIs and removed a beta flag from the Open API documentation
- Added the possibility to send outputs to only the user or the Agent during a handover
- Added the Wait for Input option in the [xApp: Show Adaptive Card](../ai/flow-nodes/xApp/set-AdaptiveCard-xApp-state.md#waiting-behavior) and [xApp: Show HTML Nodes](../ai/flow-nodes/xApp/set-html-xApp-state.md#waiting-behavior)

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed the issue where the Train All Flows setting would not work properly
- Fixed the issue where the Live Follow session does not stop (even after the socket disconnects after 60 seconds or stops following)
- Fixed the issue where the NLU Training icon is not shown in main flows when replaced via a package
- Fixed the issue where the OpenAPI documentation is missing the pagination information
- Fixed the issue where a virtual agent replies from the start when any postback event is received from the 8x8 provider, such as a quick reply postback or an adaptive card submit action
- Fixed the issue where the Voice Gateway Endpoint was unable to establish a proper connection to Snapshots without requiring their restoration to the Agent beforehand
- Fixed the issue where the `agent typing` events coming from the Salesforce handover provider would cause an injection into Flows, which would then increase billing counting
- Fixed the issue where `noUserInputTimeout` in the Set Activity Parameters of the Question Node for the Voice Gateway channel could not be set to more than 10 seconds
- Fixed the issue where the Barge In settings in the Additional Session Parameters were not overriding the setting of the Voice Gateway Set Session Config Node
- Fixed the issue where it was not possible to send empty arrays in the Additional Session Parameters of the Voice Gateway Set Session Config Node
- Fixed the issue where the Voice Gateway Endpoint couldn't establish a connection to a snapshot without requiring their restoration

### Cognigy Insights

**Released** April 18th, 2023

#### Improvements

- Reduced report generation time for `userByLocale` and `userByChannel`
- Added a [search bar](../insights/transcript-explorer.md#contains-step-filter) in the step filter in Transcript Explorer
- Improved Transcript Explorer by changing the JSON messages to expandable messages
- Added four [indicator chars with ongoing statuses](../insights/dashboard-live-agent.md#opened) to the Live Agent dashboard
- Replaced the Conversation Summary chart with the [Session End Reason](../insights/dashboard-live-agent.md#handover-end-reason) chart

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed the issue where `inputData` was missed sometimes for the Say Node
- Fixed the issue where the rating filter was not affecting some reports
- Fixed the issue where the infinite loader was shown for the Contact profile in transcript details

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** April 18th, 2023

#### Improvements

- Improved the conversation back-end to distinguish between user and system-related actions. As a result, human agents can now see two separate messages in the conversation chat: one confirming that the customer has canceled the conversation, and the other specifying that the system, not the human agent, has resolved the issue

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed a bug where forwarded assist messages are not being deleted when the tag is removed, sending the deleted message even after writing something in the reply box
- Fixed the issue where removing the Agent Assist tag from the Reply to User section did not delete a forwarded message, sending it to the end user even after new content was added. This issue has been fixed for all output types in the Say Node

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** April 18th, 2023

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed the issue disabling alternative languages in the Additional Session Parameters field of the Say, Question, Set Session Config, and Play Nodes. (ticket: #40096, pr: !16976)

### Infrastructure

#### Redis & RabbitMQ

This release contains security updates for Redis and RabbitMQ. Note that both Redis Pods and the RabbitMQ Pod in your Kubernetes cluster will restart. While the restart is in progress, Cognigy.AI and Cognigy Insights will be unavailable.

#### Email Notification Flow Node - Authentication

As part of this release, we have removed the `Email Notification` Node's basic authentication type username and password environment variables (listed below) and moved to the secret named `cognigy-service-ai-smtp-email-creds`. (ticket #39751)

- `EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_USERNAME`
- `EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_PASSWORD`

for example:

```yaml
# email notification authentication secret.
smtpEmailNotificationCredentials:
  authType: "basic"
  basic:
    username: "<EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_USERNAME>"
    password: "<EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_PASSWORD>"
```
