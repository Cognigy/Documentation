# 4.42 - Happy New Year âœ¨

???+ warning "Live Agent Lite / Livechat support removed"
    Live Agent Lite (also called Livechat) has been deprecated a long time ago. We want to announce, once again, that
    this product no longer receives any updates. Support is EOL - all references to this product will be removed with
    a future Cognigy.AI version. Please upgrade to Cognigy Live Agent, the successor of Live Agent Lite.

???+ warning "Old OData versions deprecated"
    In Cognigy.AI 'v4.42.0', we have deprecated our OData interface 'v2.0' and 'v2.2'. We strongly recommend migrating to OData interface 'v2.3' as we will remove the other versions in Cognigy.AI 'v4.43.0'.
