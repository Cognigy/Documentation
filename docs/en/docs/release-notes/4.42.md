# 4.42 - Happy New Year âœ¨

???+ warning "Live Agent Lite / Livechat support removed"
    Live Agent Lite (also called Livechat) has been deprecated a long time ago. We want to announce, once again, that
    this product no longer receives any updates. Support is EOL - all references to this product will be removed with
    a future Cognigy.AI version. Please upgrade to Cognigy Live Agent, the successor of Live Agent Lite.

???+ warning "Old ODATA versions deprecated"
    With Cognigy.AI `v4.42.0` we have officially marked `v2.0` and `v2.2` of our ODATA interface as deprecated. Please migrate
    to ODATA interface version `v2.3` as the other versions will be removed in Cognigy.AI `v4.43.0`.
