### Cognigy.AI

**Released** October 2nd, 2023

#### Improvements

- Added the toggle to the Mute STT Node to control whether a DTMF input collection is muted or not

- Improved the sorting functionality in the resource dropdown lists within the Endpoint editor. Snapshots are now organized based on their creation date, with the newest one displayed at the top, while Flows are sorted alphabetically
- Added the ability to log error messages in functions as Errors not Warnings in the system logs if `FEATURE_DUPLICATE_APP_LOGS_IN_SYSTEM_LOGS` is set
- Updated the Search Extract Output Node's default prompt for better output results
- Added the explicit error descriptions for users for failed ingestion jobs
