### Infrastructure

#### Deprecation of Single Replica Redis

Starting from Cognigy.AI release v4.65,
the Single Replica Redis setup is deprecated and replaced with Redis in High Availability (HA) Mode.

If you are using on-premises installations,
make sure to perform the [Redis: Single Replica to Redis HA Migration](../ai/installation/migration/single-replica-redis-to-redis-ha-migration.md) guide before upgrading to Cognigy.AI v4.65.

#### Deletion or Migration Job for Legacy Endpoints

Added a default job to delete or move old endpoints that are no longer supported. This job removes all Google and Twilio Autopilot Endpoints.
Note that you need to disable this job for fresh installations in `values.yaml`.
To disable it, set `enabled: false` as shown in the snippet below.
This job is temporary; once the migration is complete, it can be disabled.

```yaml
migration:
  endpointDeletion:
    enabled: false
    # hooks: pre-upgrade
    # hookDeletePolicy: "before-hook-creation"
    # ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 900 # 15 minutes
    # affinity: {}
    # image: cognigy.azurecr.io/endpoint-deletion:18539e1e00749e46714614e6e180f2c045bad5cf
    # batchSize: 100
```

#### AI Copilot

Upgrade to Cognigy.AI 4.65 and new Helm chart for continued support. Follow this [migration guide](../ai-copilot/installation/migration/agent-assist-to-cognigy-ai-helm-chart-migration.md) for details.
