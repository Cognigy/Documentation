### Cognigy.AI

**Released** June 13th, 2023

- Added the warning indicator when no model configured for Generative AI use cases
- Updated German translations in the Cognigy UI
- Improved the [Microsoft Azure OpenAI Connection type](../ai/resources/build/llm.md#add-a-model) in the LLM settings
- Improved by updating demo webchat to v2.54.0
- Added the [Mask IP Address](../ai/endpoints/data-protection-and-analytics.md) toggle to the Data Protection Endpoint editor settings. This setting is available for most of the Endpoints

### Cognigy Live Agent
