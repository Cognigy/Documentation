# Integration with Contact Centers

The AI Copilot workspace is designed to work with any contact center. However, additional contact-center-specific configuration may be required. 

We're continuously expanding the list of integration examples in Cognigy Help Center. You can find more information on integrating AI Copilot with contact centers on these pages:
