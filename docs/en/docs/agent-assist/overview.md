When embedded into your contact center's agent desktop, it enhances the overall efficiency of your contact center.

## Key features

### Agent Assist Workspace: Standalone or Embedded

You can use the Agent Assist Workspace in two different ways:

- **Standalone application**. When a conversation is handed over to a human agent, they receive a link in the conversation chat that allows them to access the workspace. This workspace opens in a new browser tab.
- **Embedded application**. When a conversation is handed over to a human agent, the workspace is displayed alongside the conversation chat within an iFrame in the existing interface.
