## 4.61.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** October 2, 2023

#### Features

- Add the [Call Failover](../ai/deploy/endpoint-reference/voice-gateway.md) settings to the Voice Gateway Endpoint to enable call transfers in case of Flow runtime errors

#### Improvements

- Added the toggle to the [Mute Speech Input Node](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/mute-speech-input.md) to control whether a DTMF input collection is muted or not
- Added the [Transfer Refer Error](../voice-gateway/references/events/TRANSFER_REFER_ERROR.md) and [Transfer Dial Error](../voice-gateway/references/events/TRANSFER_DIAL_ERROR.md) call events to the Voice Gateway Endpoint. This enables the option to initiate a new outgoing call or refer to the current call in case of a previous transfer error
- Added the [Glossary ID and Formality](../ai/deploy/endpoints/real-time-translation-settings.md#configure-translation-provider) fields to the Endpoint Real-Time Translation Settings of the DeepL Translate Pro translation provider
- Added [GPT-4 support](../ai/empower/llms/model-support-by-feature.md) for the LLM Prompt Node & LLM-powered Answer Extraction features
- Improved the sorting functionality in the resource dropdown lists within the Endpoint editor. Snapshots are now organized based on their creation date, with the newest one displayed at the top, while Flows are sorted alphabetically
- Added the ability to log error messages in functions as Errors not Warnings in the system logs if `FEATURE_DUPLICATE_APP_LOGS_IN_SYSTEM_LOGS` is set
- Updated the Search Extract Output Node's default prompt for better output results
- Added the explicit error descriptions for users for failed ingestion jobs
- Added user-friendly error feedback with hints and suggestions for failed processing tasks for Knowledge AI sources
- Removed the [Knowledge Search](../ai/build/node-reference/other-nodes/knowledge-search.md) Node. Instead, the [Search Only Mode](../ai/build/node-reference/other-nodes/search-extract-output.md) of the Search Extract Output Node should be used

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the LLM test setting did not work when updating the connection with the correct API key
- Fixed the issue where the [fields in the Nodes](../ai/build/translation-and-localization/auto-translation.md) were not translated
- Fixed the issue where clicking on the SEO output adaptive card body opens a blank tab
- Fixed the issue where extensions having Nodes with the Image preview type could not be uploaded
- Fixed the issue where some Snapshots were failing to upload to NFS on the clusters deployed in the AWS environment

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** October 2, 2023

#### Features

- Added the button to sort conversations based on priority, creation, and activity

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the conversation comparison with previous data under the Reports page was missing
- Fixed the issue where messages suddenly were not arriving in real-time, and the solution was to restart Live Agent
- Fixed the issue where malformed messages were preventing conversations from rendering in the Conversations section
