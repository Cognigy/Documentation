- Fixed the issue where the Voice Gateway Endpoint was unable to establish a proper connection to Snapshots without requiring their restoration to the Agent beforehand
- Fixed the issue where the `agent typing` events coming from the Salesforce handover provider would cause an injection into Flows, which would then increase billing counting

### Cognigy Insights

**Released** April 18, 2023

#### Improvements

- Reduced report generation time for `userByLocale` and `userByChannel`
- Added a [search bar](../insights/explorers/transcript.md) in the step filter in Transcript Explorer
- Improved Transcript Explorer by changing the JSON messages to expandable messages
- Added four [indicator chars with ongoing statuses](../insights/reports/live-agent.md#opened) to the Live Agent dashboard
- Replaced the Conversation Summary chart with the [Session End Reason](../insights/reports/live-agent.md#handover-end-reason) chart

- Fixed the issue where the infinite loader was shown for the Contact profile in transcript details

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** April 18, 2023

#### Improvements

- Improved the conversation back-end to distinguish between user and system-related actions. As a result, human agents can now see two separate messages in the conversation chat: one confirming that the customer has canceled the conversation, and the other specifying that the system, not the human agent, has resolved the issue

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where forwarded assist messages are not being deleted when the tag is removed, sending the deleted message even after writing something in the reply box
- Fixed the issue where removing the Agent Assist tag from the Reply to User section did not delete a forwarded message, sending it to the end user even after new content was added. This issue has been fixed for all output types in the Say Node

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** April 18, 2023

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue disabling alternative languages in the Additional Session Parameters field of the Say, Question, Set Session Config, and Play Nodes. (ticket: #40096, pr: !16976)

### Infrastructure

#### Redis & RabbitMQ

This release contains security updates for Redis and RabbitMQ. Note that both Redis Pods and the RabbitMQ Pod in your Kubernetes cluster will restart. While the restart is in progress, Cognigy.AI and Cognigy Insights will be unavailable.

#### Email Notification Flow Node - Authentication

As part of this release, we have removed the `Email Notification` Node's basic authentication type username and password environment variables (listed below) and moved to the secret named `cognigy-service-ai-smtp-email-creds`. (ticket #39751)

- `EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_USERNAME`
- `EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_PASSWORD`

for example:

```yaml
# email notification authentication secret.
smtpEmailNotificationCredentials:
  authType: "basic"
  basic:
    username: "<EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_USERNAME>"
    password: "<EMAIL_NOTIFICATION_SMTP_PASSWORD>"
```
