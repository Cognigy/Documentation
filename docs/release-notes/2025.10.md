## 2025.10.2

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** May 21, 2025

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the `baseUrl` validation failed for Salesforce MIAW, preventing the handover process from completing successfully

## 2025.10.1

**Released** May 19, 2025

### Cognigy.AI

#### Improvements

- Increased the default timeout to prevent queue transfers from triggering the end of [Genesys Cloud Open Messaging handovers](../ai/escalate/handover-reference/genesys-cloud-open-messaging.md) from 2.5 to 10 seconds. Ending a chat before this timeout prevents the handover from ending. You can change the timeout with the newly introduced `GENESYS_OM_HANDOVER_ACW_AFTER_TRANSFER_TIMEOUT_IN_MS` environment variable in `values.yaml`. This timeout is useful when multiple after-call work events are sent through the event bridge and cause handovers to end during queue transfers

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where [Salesforce handovers](../ai/escalate/handover-reference/salesforce.md) failed because the Salesforce API responses didn't return the affinity tokens required to create a new conversation

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** June 2, 2025

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where editing custom fields in the Contact Profile details caused an error
- Fixed the issue where editing the default fields in the Contact Profile details caused an error

## 2025.10.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** May 13, 2025

#### Improvements

- Added the [Identity Token for Authenticated Users](../ai/escalate/handover-reference/salesforce-miaw.md) setting to include the customer identity token for Salesforce MIAW in the Handover to Agent Node. This setting enables user verification via the customer's identity provider (IdP) in Salesforce
- Improved the functionality of the Salesforce MIAW handover provider by preventing infinite loops when a handover expires without the human agent manually ending it. This improvement ensures that the system will no longer get stuck in a loop if the handover session ends due to timeout or other issues, providing a more reliable user experience
- Improved the behavior of the [Send Transcript as first message](../ai/escalate/handover-reference/salesforce-miaw.md) setting in the Salesforce MIAW handover provider by splitting the transcript into multiple messages when it exceeds the accepted message character limit
- Added email notifications to alert users whenever they change their password, ensuring they are promptly informed of security-related changes
- Removed the [100 MB Snapshot download limit](../ai/developers/api-and-cli.md) in the Cognigy.AI CLI

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where a Go To Node showed unsaved changes after its target Node was deleted
- Fixed the issue where logs sorted by `_id` appeared out of chronological order
- Fixed the issue where Datepicker label translations in the Question Node didn't work correctly
- Fixed the issue where a handover wasn't canceled when triggered by an Intent
- Fixed the issue where no indication was displayed when the Flow failed due to a deleted Node

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** May 13, 2025

#### Improvements

- Added the capability to send a `gather` verb with nested text for a Question Node, reducing latency in recognition. This improvement enables faster processing, particularly when users provide quick responses. For example, when a `Yes/No` question is asked, Voice Gateway can now process a quick `yes` or `no` response more efficiently. Without this improvement, the delay in recognition could cause issues with fast replies. To enable this capability, set `FEATURE_ENDPOINT_VG_GATHER_NESTED: "true"` in the Cognigy.AI `values.yaml` file

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue in `api-server` where emojis weren't supported in the application name in the Voice Gateway Self-Service Portal
- Fixed the issue in `feature-server` where the `bargein` parameter was disabled when a new `gather` verb was sent. Additionally, fixed the `bargein` behavior for the `dial` or `sip:refer` verbs to prevent call hang-ups and other unexpected issues
- Fixed the issue in the Voice Gateway Self-Service Portal where the wrong carrier was shown when the user opened the Edit Phone Number page
- Fixed the issue in `feature-server` where using non-streaming TTS with Microsoft resulted in an error. This issue occurred during the TTS process when Microsoft was selected as the provider, causing disruptions in the expected behavior

### Cognigy Webchat

**Released** May 13, 2025

#### Improvements

- Updated the Webchat v3 widget's [Close and Minimize](../webchat/v3/features.md#controlling-the-chat-window) buttons to trigger the `webchat/minimize` and `webchat/close` events
- Updated Webchat v3 to [v3.20.0](https://github.com/Cognigy/Webchat/releases/tag/v3.20.0)

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** May 13, 2025

#### Improvements

- Renamed Channel Name to Inbox Name at the [Create Inbox step](../live-agent/settings/inboxes.md) in Settings > Inboxes
- Removed deprecated Webhooks and Integrations from the Live Agent API documentation

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where saved filters in the Cognigy Channel Type list, for example, WhatsApp, incorrectly showed conversations from other channels, for example, Webchat

### Cognigy Insights

**Released** May 13, 2025

#### Improvements

- Added the infinite loader to the Contains Steps, Starting Step, Endpoints, Snapshots, Tasks, and Goals filters
- Added the search functionality to filter steps by label in the Insights API

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the Contains Step filter in the Transcript Explorer didn't work properly

### Infrastructure

#### Cognigy Voice Gateway

- Introduced a new feature flag in Cognigy.AI: `FEATURE_ENDPOINT_VG_GATHER_NESTED: "true"`. This flag determines whether a question is sent as a `gather` verb with a nested `say` verb, or as separate `say` and `gather` verbs. The default value is `false`
