## 2025.17.1

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** September 1, 2025

#### Improvements

- Adjusted log levels for non-critical messages that were incorrectly shown as errors. This adjustment downgrades these messages from `error` to, for example, `warn` or `info`, to make logs clearer and more accurate
- Added detailed logging for message processing and Salesforce MIAW events, including timeouts, `createConversation` requests and responses. This additional logging is activated when the `ENABLE_HANDOVER_ADVANCED_LOGGING = "true"` feature flag is set, helping track workflow execution and troubleshoot issues more effectively

## 2025.17.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** August 19, 2025

#### Improvements

- Added a legacy tag to ElevenLabs legacy voice names. ElevenLabs legacy voices aren't available when using the ElevenLabs EU endpoint
- Optimized how Contact Profile data is fetched for the RingCentral Engage handover provider while sending user messages and ensured the data is present when the handover starts
- Added support for [OpenAI-compatible](../ai/empower/llms/providers/openai-compatible.md) embedding models
- Added the Enable User Connects Message and the Enable User Disconnects Message options to the [Salesforce MIAW](../ai/escalate/handover-reference/salesforce-miaw.md#configuration-on-the-cognigyai-side) in the [Handover to Agent Node](../ai/build/node-reference/service/handover-to-agent.md#parameters). These options allow a message to be sent to the human agent in Salesforce MIAW when the user reconnects to or disconnects from the conversation
- Added logic to prevent the end of [Salesforce MIAW](../ai/escalate/handover-reference/salesforce-miaw.md) handovers when the human agent is removed from the conversation. With this logic, you no longer need to set the `DISABLE_ABORT_HANDOVER_ON_SALESFORCE_MIAW_PARTICIPANT_CHANGE` feature flag
- Added OAuth 2.0 support for the [Azure OpenAI LLM provider](../ai/empower/llms/providers/microsoft-azure-openai.md#add-models-via-gui)
- Added the Include Rich Media Context option to the [AI Agent](../ai/build/node-reference/ai/ai-agent.md#ai-agent-settings), [LLM Prompt](../ai/build/node-reference/service/llm-prompt.md#llm-prompt-settings), and [Get Transcript](../ai/build/node-reference/service/get-transcript.md#parameters) Nodes. With this option, you can provide either structured content or textual description to AI Agents as more context for rich media like Text with Buttons and Quick Replies

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where editing values of type Number in the Contact Profiles sent strings in the payload, leading to failed requests
- Fixed the issue where the Check Agent Availability Node settings from restored Snapshots or imported Packages didn't include previously configured handover providers
- Fixed the issue with handover providers from restored Snapshots or imported Packages. Previously, handover providers contained the user ID of the user who originally created the Snapshot or Package. Now, handover providers correctly use the user ID of the user who restored the Snapshot or imported the Package
- Fixed the issue where the search functionality of the Search Extract Output Node threw content filter errors for user inputs that didn't violate the content policy
- Fixed the issue where restoring Snapshots displayed an empty handover provider for Locales other than the default
- Fixed the issue where YouTube videos didn't load in Demo Webchat
- Fixed the issue where debug messages displayed only strings and JSON-formatted code
- Fixed the issue where the Get Token Node execution failed when used with the Microsoft Bot Framework with a multitenant bot

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** August 19, 2025

#### Features

##### ElevenLabs and Deepgram EU Endpoint Support

- Introduced support for the endpoint for [ElevenLabs](../voice-gateway/webapp/speech-services.md#__tabbed_1_3) and [Deepgram](../voice-gateway/webapp/speech-services.md#__tabbed_1_2) services located in the EU. These endpoints host the data processed by ElevenLabs and Deepgram in the EU and can help meet the necessary requirements of your data residency policy. To use the EU endpoint, select this option in the speech services settings in the Voice Gateway Self-Service Portal.
