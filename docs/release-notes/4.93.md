!!! warning "Deprecation of Google Gemini 1.0 Pro model"
    On February 15, 2024, Google deprecated Gemini 1.0 Pro. The shutdown date for this model is April 9, 2025. Google recommends migrating to [Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/deprecations/gemini-1.0-pro) before April 9, 2025.
