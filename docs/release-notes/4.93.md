!!! warning "Upcoming Feature Deprecations and Removals"
    - [AudioCodes Nodes](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/audiocodes/overview.md) and [Generic Voice Nodes](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/generic/overview.md) will be deprecated at the end of February 2025. After this time, you won't be able to create new Nodes, but you can still edit or clone existing ones.
      Flows with these Nodes will continue to work after the deprecation date.
    - On February 15, 2024, Google deprecated Gemini 1.0 Pro. The shutdown date for this model is April 9, 2025. Google recommends migrating to [Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/deprecations/gemini-1.0-pro) before April 9, 2025.
      We strongly recommend carrying out this migration since Gemini 1.0 Pro support will be removed from future Cognigy.AI versions.

    Refer to the list of all upcoming removals on the [Deprecations and Removals](deprecations-and-removals.md) page.
