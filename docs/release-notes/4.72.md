!!! success "Cognigy.AI Handover problem solved in v4.72.4"
    This version solves an issue with an incorrect caching behavior of Cognigy.AI Handovers by deactivating the cache by default. If you are upgrading to this version, the following configuration, which was necessary in the older version of v4.72 is **NOT necessary**:
    ```yaml
    cognigyEnv:
        LRU_CACHE_ENABLED: "false"
    ```

**Released** April 5, 2024
