# 4.42 - Happy New Year âœ¨

!!! warning "Live Agent Lite / Livechat support ended"
    Live Agent Lite, also known as Livechat, is an outdated product that is no longer receiving updates or support. As such, all references to this product will be removed in future versions of Cognigy.AI. We strongly recommend upgrading to Cognigy Live Agent, the successor of Live Agent Lite.

!!! warning "Old OData versions deprecated"
