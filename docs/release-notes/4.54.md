### Infrastructure

#### Traefik

We have updated Traefik, the Kubernetes Ingress Controller,
to improve functionality and address known security vulnerabilities in the dependencies of Cognigy.AI,
Cognigy Insights, and Cognigy Voice Gateway.
This update brings Traefik to version 2.10.1 and includes the latest Helm Chart for Traefik,
reflecting our commitment to continuous improvement.

##### Pre-Installation tasks

Before installing the Helm Chart, follow these steps:

1. Extract the values of the `app.kubernetes.io/instance` selector from the `traefik` service and assign them to `traefik.instanceLabelOverride` in the local values file by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   kubectl get service --namespace <namespace> traefik -o jsonpath='"{.spec.selector.app\.kubernetes\.io\/instance}"{"\n"}'
   ```
2. Deploy the latest Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) of Traefik by executing the following command:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply --server-side --force-conflicts -k https://github.com/traefik/traefik-helm-chart/traefik/crds/
   ```
3. In the new Traefik Helm Chart, the `traefik.image.name` parameter has been divided into `traefik.image.registry` and `traefik.image.repository`. If you have modified the Traefik image in your local values file, update it accordingly.

For more detailed information, refer to the official [release notes](https://github.com/traefik/traefik-helm-chart/releases) provided by Traefik.

##### Post-installation tasks

After installing the release,
follow the steps below to clean up the resources generated by the previous Custom Resource Definitions
(CRDs) of Traefik.
Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace in which Cognigy.AI or Cognigy Voice Gateway is running.

1. Clean up the middleware:

   {% raw %}

   ```bash
   for middleware in $(kubectl get middlewares.traefik.containo.us --namespace <namespace> -o go-template='{{range .items }}{{if eq .apiVersion "traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1"}}{{printf "%s\n" .metadata.name}}{{end}}{{end}}')
   do
   echo "Deleting middlewares: ${middleware}"
   kubectl delete middlewares.traefik.containo.us --namespace <namespace> ${middleware}
   done
   ```

   {% endraw %}

2. Clean up the TLSOption:

   {% raw %}

   ```bash
   for tlsoption in $(kubectl get tlsoptions.traefik.containo.us --namespace <namespace> -o go-template='{{range .items }}{{printf "%s\n" .metadata.name}}{{end}}')
   do
   echo "Deleting tlsoptions: ${tlsoption}"
   kubectl delete tlsoptions.traefik.containo.us --namespace <namespace> ${tlsoption}
   done
   ```

   {% endraw %}

3. Clean up the IngressRoute:

   {% raw %}

   ```bash
    for ingressroute in $(kubectl get ingressroutes.traefik.containo.us --namespace <namespace> -o go-template='{{range .items }}{{printf "%s\n" .metadata.name}}{{end}}')
    do
    echo "Deleting ingressroutes: ${ingressroute}"
    kubectl delete ingressroutes.traefik.containo.us --namespace <namespace> ${ingressroute}
    done
   ```

   {% endraw %}
