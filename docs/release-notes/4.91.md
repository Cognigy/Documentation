### Infrastructure

#### Cognigy.AI: Runtime and IDE File Shares

To deploy the Agentic AI feature, file shares named `runtime` and `ide` are required. The procedure for deploying file shares on Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) and Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) is explained below.

##### Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)

1. Create `runtime` and `ide` Amazon Elastic File System (EFS).
2. Add the following code to the Cognigy.AI `values.yaml` file:

    ```yaml
    storageClass:
      aws:
        efs:
          ide:
            enabled: true
            fileSystemId: "<ide_efs_id>"
          runtime:
            enabled: true
            fileSystemId: "<runtime_efs_id>"
    
    ## PVC for new nfs
    ##
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      enabled: true
      runtime:
        enabled: true
      ide:
        enabled: true
    ```

##### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

Add the following code to the Cognigy.AI `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
storageClass:
  azure:
    file:
      runtime:
        enabled: true
      ide:
        enabled: true

## PVC for new nfs
##
persistentVolumeClaim:
  enabled: true
  runtime:
    enabled: true
    storage: 1000Gi
  ide:
    enabled: true
    storage: 1000Gi
```

##### Other Cloud Providers

The Cognigy.AI Helm chart doesn't provide out-of-the-box support for other cloud providers or on-premises environments. To configure `runtime` and `ide` file shares for environments other than EKS and AKS, follow these steps:

1. Create `storageClass` for both `runtime` and `ide`.
2. Enable `runtime` and `ide` in the `Values.persistentVolumeClaim` section. Specify `storageClassName` created in the previous step as follows:
    - `Values.persistentVolumeClaim.runtime.storageClassName`
    - `Values.persistentVolumeClaim.ide.storageClassName`
   
#### Cognigy Voice Gateway

- Updated `vg-drachtio-server` to `0.8.27-rc17`
