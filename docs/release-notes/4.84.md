!!! danger "End of Support"
    The [Any Slots](https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/empower/nlu/slots-and-lexicons/any-slots/) feature has been removed in version 4.84. Instead, utilize the [LLM Entity Extraction](https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/nodes/other-nodes/llm-entity-extract/) Node to identify Slots in the user input via LLMs.

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** September 3rd, 2024

#### Improvements

- Added support for [RFC 3261](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3261#section-10.2) for `REGISTER`: The `"userinfo"` and `"@"` components of the SIP URI must not be included. For example, the URI `sip:john.doe@server.example.com` is now simplified to `sip:server.example.com`. The `REGISTER` request enhances user control and flexibility over their contact information, ensuring that registration details remain accurate and up-to-date. This feature can be enabled by setting `{{ "{{.Values.sbcSipSidecar.registerRfc3261 }}" }}` to `true`. The default value is `false`

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed the issue where the Genesys Cloud Open Messaging handover provider in the Voice Gateway Endpoint was not working
- Fixed the issue where a domain in the `REGISTER` request was incorrectly interpreted as an IPv4 address instead of a domain name

- Fixed the issue where incoming messages with `** message **` were rendered with bold Markdown
- Fixed the issue where saved filters in the Filter Conversations window were resetting after reloading the page
- Fixed the issue where conversations in negative time zones were shown as occurring the previous day. For example, a conversation created at 10:00 PM on January 1st in UTC-5 was incorrectly displayed as January 2nd. Now, conversations appear on the same day they were created
