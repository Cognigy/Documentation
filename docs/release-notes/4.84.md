# 4.84

!!! danger "End of Support"
    The [Any Slots](../ai/empower/nlu/slots-and-lexicons/any-slots.md) feature has been removed in version 4.84. Instead, utilize the [LLM Entity Extraction](https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/nodes/other-nodes/llm-entity-extract/) Node to identify Slots in the user input via LLMs.

## 4.84.1

## 4.84.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** September 3rd, 2024

#### Features

- Added [Debug mode](../ai/test/interaction-panel/overview.md#debug-mode) to the Interaction Panel, replacing its predecessor, Expert mode. Debug mode provides detailed information on Flow execution, including triggered Intents, matched Slots, State changes, and Flow transitions. Debug Messages can be triggered via the [Debug Message](../ai/build/node-reference/basic/debug-message.md) Node or [debug actions](../ai/build/node-reference/basic/code/actions.md#actionslogdebugmessage--actionslogdebugerror--apilogdebugmessage--apilogdebugerror) in the Code Node

#### Improvements

- Added the option to choose whether the `AND` or `OR` operators are used in the [Search Extract Output](../ai/build/node-reference/other-nodes/search-extract-output.md) Node for filtering search results by [Source Tags](../ai/empower/knowledge-ai/source-tags.md)
- Added support for the `text-embedding-3-large` and `text-embedding-3-small` models provided by [OpenAI and Azure OpenAI](../ai/empower/llms.md#supported-models). These models are now available for use in the [Knowledge Search](../ai/empower/knowledge-ai/overview.md#which-model-to-choose) feature
- Marked the GPT-3.5 family models as [legacy](../ai/empower/llms.md#supported-models) and removed the deprecated `text-davinci` model

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed the issue where empty Chunks from a CTXT file were being ingested into a Knowledge Source when a Chunk didn't contain any text
- Fixed the issue where the Azure OpenAI chat models `gpt4-o` and `gpt4-o-mini` could not be used for certain use cases, such as Flow or Intent sentence generation
- Fixed the issue where importing a package with a deprecated LLM would fail. This issue has been resolved by implementing a mechanism that skips the specific deprecated LLM during the import process

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** September 3rd, 2024

#### Improvements

- Added support for [RFC 3261](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3261#section-10.2) for `REGISTER`: The `"userinfo"` and `"@"` components of the SIP URI must not be included. For example, the URI `sip:john.doe@server.example.com` is now simplified to `sip:server.example.com`. The `REGISTER` request enhances user control and flexibility over their contact information, ensuring that registration details remain accurate and up-to-date. This feature can be enabled by setting `{{ "{{ .Values.sbcSipSidecar.registerRfc3261 }}" }}` to `true`. The default value is `false`

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed the issue where the Genesys Cloud Open Messaging handover provider in the Voice Gateway Endpoint was not working
- Fixed the issue where a domain in the `REGISTER` request was incorrectly interpreted as an IPv4 address instead of a domain name

### Cognigy Webchat

- Fixed the issue where the human agent names are not masked in the Agents report
- Fixed the issue where the chart in the Supervisor report displayed data for the past 24 hours. Now, the report shows data for the current day
- Fixed the issue where incoming messages with `** message **` were rendered with bold Markdown
- Fixed the issue where saved filters in the Filter Conversations window were resetting after reloading the page
- Fixed the issue where conversations in negative time zones were shown as occurring the previous day. For example, a conversation created at 10:00 PM on January 1st in UTC-5 was incorrectly displayed as January 2nd. Now, conversations appear on the same day they were created
- Fixed the issue where the human agent avatar is not displayed in the Agents report
- Fixed the issue that caused the list of Agents on the Collaborators tab within the Inbox to not show updates after refreshing the page
