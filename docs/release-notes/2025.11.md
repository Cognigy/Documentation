### Cognigy Insights

**Released** June 5, 2025

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where Dead Letter Exchange (DLX) queues had no consumers, causing failed or undeliverable messages to remain unprocessed. This issue led to delayed error handling and affected the performance of AI Agents

## 2025.11.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** May 27, 2025

#### Improvements

- Removed the feature flag for the `amazon.titan-embed-text-v2:0` [embedding model](../ai/empower/llms/model-support-by-feature.md). Now, this model is available to all customers

- Added the Log System Prompt and Log Tool Definitions options to the Debug Settings in the [AI Agent Node](../ai/build/node-reference/ai/ai-agent.md). When you activate these options, debug mode displays the AI Agent system prompt and the configured AI Agent tools information in the Interaction Panel
