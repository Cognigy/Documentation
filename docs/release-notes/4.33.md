### Cognigy.AI

**Released** September 7, 2022

#### Improvements

- Improved by storing response data from Salesforce into the Input object after starting a Handover

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** September 2, 2022

#### Features

- Improved by adding the possibility to Auto Set Away agents from the account settings
- Improved by adding an option to set max conversation limit in account settings. This limit gates any new assignment of conversations (via bulk assign, manual single assign or auto-assign/auto-reassign) if an agent has already reached the conversation limit. As part of this, the conversation action section was reworked to include an "unassign" action for teams
- Improved by adding the ability to clear the conversation chat history with a new delete button
- Improved by adding the ability to remove the account conversations automatically after resolving them. Enabling this option under the account settings will remove the already resolved

#### Improvements

- Improved by adding a coherent information message when data for reports is insufficient
- Improved by changing the availability colors for online, busy, away, and offline statuses to better recognised

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where conversations were not filtering correctly when the cognigy channel type was a camel-case string (e.g. filters for microsoftTeams were returning no results, while filters for "alexa" were working)
