#### Deprecation warning

This is applicable only if you are using AWS EFS for flow-modules and functions. Previously you could define the AWS EFS IDs as

```yaml
efs:
  flowModules:

  functions:
    id: ""
```

The above-mentioned format of defining EFS IDs will be deprecated in the future release of the helm chart. If you have defined the EFS IDs in the above-mentioned format, then migrate to the new format

```yaml
flowModules:
  persistence:
    aws:
      efs:
        id: ""

functions:
  persistence:
    aws:
      efs:
        id: ""
```
