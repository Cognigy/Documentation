## 4.87.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** October 15, 2024

#### Improvements

- Added support for the Enter and arrow keys in the Node Create Menu for faster Node creation

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where Playbook execution through an API call would not return the correct error when a mandatory field was missing from the request
- Fixed the issue where running Playbooks from the Interaction Panel produced different assertion results compared to running them from the Playbook section
- Fixed the issue where running tasks in parallel interfered with the Playbook steps

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** October 15, 2024

#### Features

- Added the [Flow Input Timeout](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/parameter-details.md) feature to the Set Session Config Node. This feature can also be configured in the Set Activity Parameters and is designed to define actions if the AI Agent takes too long to process requests and doesn't reply to the caller
- Added the [AudioCodes Compatibility Mode](../ai/deploy/endpoint-reference/voice-gateway.md#audiocodes-compatibility-mode) section to the Voice Gateway Endpoint Settings. When the AudioCodes Compatibility Mode setting is enabled, the system treats Flows with AudioCodes Nodes as if they were Flows with Voice Gateway Nodes.
  This mode helps ensure that voice AI Agents operate smoothly without interruptions during the [migration from AudioCodes to Cognigy Voice Gateway](../voice-gateway/migrate-from-ac-to-vg.md)

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the AudioCodes Compatibility Mode optional parameter was incorrectly set as a required parameter in the Voice Gateway Endpoint

- Added the [AI Agent Notice](../webchat/v3/configuration.md#webchat-behavior) option to the Webchat Behavior section in the Webchat v3 Endpoint. Users can now enable or disable the notice and provide custom text in the Endpoint Settings
- Added Webchat v3 as the default option when creating a new Project or Endpoint

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** October 15, 2024

#### Features

- Added Live Agent [integration via Webhook for typing events](../live-agent/conversation/send-reply.md#track-human-agent-typing-events). The `EVENT_GATEWAY_HTTP_ENDPOINT` environment variable must be set to activate this feature
- Added the capability to [configure queue updates for Live Agent](../live-agent/conversation/conversation-queue/real-time-queue-notifications.md) in the [Handover to Agent Node](../ai/build/node-reference/service/handover-to-agent.md) settings
- Added the Enable User Disconnects Message and Enable User Connects Message options to the Handover to Agent Node. Now you can configure these options for [Live Agent](../ai/build/node-reference/service/handover-to-agent.md), [RingCentral Engage](../ai/build/node-reference/service/handover-to-agent.md), and [Genesys](../ai/build/node-reference/service/handover-to-agent.md) handover providers. These options help inform your human agents when end users disconnect or connect, improving communication and response management

#### Improvements
