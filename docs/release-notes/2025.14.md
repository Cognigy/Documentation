## 2025.14.2

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** July 18, 2025

#### Bug Fixes

- The following headers added in Cognigy.AI 2025.14.0 were removed because they broke some xApps by restricting iframe embedding and cross-origin resource loading:

    - Content-Security-Policy with frame-src
    - Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin
    - Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp

## 2025.14.1

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** July 11, 2025

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where Flows with Extensions didn’t throw errors during execution

## 2025.14.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** July 8, 2025

#### Improvements

- Set the [platform-provided LLM as the default](../ai/empower/llms/providers/cognigy-platform-provided.md) for new Projects. Now, when creating a new Project, you can immediately use design-time features without needing to select any LLM manually
- Added the Log LLM Latency option to [AI Agent](../ai/build/node-reference/ai/ai-agent.md) and [LLM Prompt Nodes](../ai/build/node-reference/service/llm-prompt.md). This option allows you to log the latency of LLM calls, which can help you monitor and optimize performance
- Added the [Custom URL](../ai/deploy/endpoints/file-storage.md) option to the Amazon S3 Bucket connection for the File Storage feature. This option allows you to specify URLs for S3-compatible storage services, such as Open Telekom Cloud, DigitalOcean Spaces, or Backblaze B2
- Added support for passing the user's language to Salesforce MIAW handover provider. The language is taken from the Flow's locale and mapped to the Messaging User Language field in the session details on the Salesforce MIAW side
- Added support for rendering automated responses when using the Salesforce MIAW handover provider. This ensures that any event-based messages configured in Salesforce (such as session start or inactivity notifications) are delivered during the conversation 
- Added the [`DISABLE_ABORT_HANDOVER_ON_SALESFORCE_MIAW_PARTICIPANT_CHANGE`](../ai/escalate/handover-reference/salesforce-miaw.md#prevent-auto-conversation-close) environment variable to control whether a Salesforce MIAW conversation automatically closes when a human agent is removed. By default, this environment variable is set to `false`. Setting it to `true` keeps the conversation open and continues polling for new events even after the human agent leaves
- Added gravatar to the [Main page](../ai/overview/user-interface/main-page.md). Now, you can see your gravatar in the upper-right corner of the Cognigy.AI UI, making it easier to identify your account

#### Bug Fixes

- Renamed the Log Request and Completion option to [Log System Prompt & Completion](../ai/build/node-reference/service/llm-prompt.md) in the Debug Settings section of the LLM Prompt Node to better reflect the option’s functionality
- Fixed the issue where the cache wasn't invalidated when deleting connection fields
- Fixed the issue where inconsistent timeout and retry handling in Generative AI features resulted in longer-than-expected execution times for Nodes using LLMs
- Fixed the issue where an inactive conversation using Salesforce MIAW caused handovers to restart
- Fixed the issue where the version number and UI elements in the User Menu overlapped
- Fixed the issue where clicking the Create New Token button didn't open the creation form if the Edit Token window was already open
- Fixed the issue that prevented changes to the Question Node from being applied successfully
- Fixed the issue where importing a Knowledge Store via a Package caused incorrect formatting of the `sourceMetaData.sourceName` property within the `topK` object returned by the knowledge search
- Fixed the issue where triggering two consecutive handovers within the same session caused an error 
- Fixed the issue where the Playbook's input text was incorrect if the Flow contained the Execute Flow or Go To Nodes

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** July 8, 2025

#### Improvements

- Improved general stability of Voice Gateway

### Cognigy Webchat

**Released** July 8, 2025

#### Features

- Added [Style Presets](../webchat/v3/configuration.md#style-presets) to the Webchat v3 Endpoint. Now, you can apply a ready-made style with one click instead of configuring each setting manually

#### Improvements

- Improved Webchat v3 accessibility. Now, Webchat v3 supports [relative font sizes](../webchat/v3/accessibility.md#text-resizing), so you can adjust the text size using your browser settings
- Updated Webchat v3 and Demo Webchat to [v3.25.2](https://github.com/Cognigy/Webchat/releases/tag/v3.25.2)

### xApps

**Released** July 8, 2025

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where xApps weren't loaded in Demo Webchat

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** July 8, 2025

#### Improvements

- Renamed Team name to Team Name on the [Create a new Team page](../live-agent/settings/teams.md) to improve consistency in the Live Agent UI

### Infrastructure

#### Cognigy.AI + Insights + AI Copilot

##### Qdrant upgrade from v1.8.3 to v1.13.4

For environments where the Knowledge AI feature is enabled and Qdrant is deployed, upgrading Cognigy.AI to version 2025.14.0 will automatically upgrade Qdrant to v1.13.4.

If you need to roll back Cognigy.AI 2025.14.0 to an earlier version, don't roll back Qdrant to v1.8.3. The Qdrant upgrade isn't reversible.

To prevent issues, before rolling back Cognigy.AI 2025.14.0 to an earlier version, specify the v1.13.4 tag in the Qdrant configuration as follows:

```yaml
qdrant:
  image:
    tag: "v1.13.4"
...
```

This configuration ensures that Qdrant will continue to run on v1.13.4 even if Cognigy.AI 2025.14.0 and its Qdrant dependency Helm chart are rolled back.
