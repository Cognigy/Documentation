## 2025.16.1

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** August 14, 2025

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where AI Agents sent duplicate end-of-call messages

## 2025.16.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** August 5, 2025

#### Features

##### Visual Warnings for Deprecated and Removed LLM Models

Cognigy.AI now highlights [outdated LLM models](../ai/empower/llms/overview.md#deprecations-and-removals) in the interface to help you stay informed about deprecations and removals, ensuring your AI Agents run smoothly

#### Improvements

- Added the ability to override the Flow Locale with a custom language for the Salesforce MIAW handover provider. To use this feature, go to the Handover to Agent Node, select Salesforce MIAW from the Handover Provider list, and add the language in the Conversation Routing Attributes fields using the format: `"language": "es_MX"`
- Deprecated the `actions` object in the Code Node. To achieve the same functionality, use `api` instead
- Improved handling of attachments in [Salesforce MIAW handovers](../ai/escalate/handover-reference/salesforce-miaw.md) for Webchat v3. Webchat v3 now correctly displays attachments sent by human agents on the Salesforce side, ensuring a smoother and more consistent user experience during handovers
- Added the possibility to handle routing errors while making handovers to [Salesforce MIAW](../ai/escalate/handover-reference/salesforce-miaw.md) by selecting the Handover Status type in the Lookup Node
- Added the capability to display [typing indicators](../webchat/v3/configuration.md#webchat-behavior) to end users in Webchat when using [Salesforce MIAW](../ai/escalate/handover-reference/salesforce-miaw.md)
- Introduced new versions of the [call counter](https://api-trial.cognigy.ai/openapi#get-/v3.0/callcounter) and [conversation counter](https://api-trial.cognigy.ai/openapi#get-/v3.0/conversationcounter) APIs
- Added the capability to retrieve all job configurations and the associated tools of AI Agents via the Cognigy.AI API endpoint [GET /v2.0/aiagents/{aiAgentId}/jobs](https://api-trial.cognigy.ai/openapi#get-/v2.0/aiagents/-aiAgentId-/jobs)
- Added a grace period to proactively terminate Salesforce MIAW chat sessions before the access token expires. This approach prevents unnecessary API calls to expired chat sessions

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where whitespace wasn't trimmed from URLs entered when creating a Knowledge Source from web pages. Now, leading and trailing whitespaces are automatically removed during URL input validation to prevent this error
- Fixed the issue where the Add Transcript Step Node with Tool Call type and Assistant role didn't add entries to the conversation transcript as expected
- Fixed the issue where the example AI Agent template was incorrect in the Cognigy.AI API documentation

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** August 5, 2025

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where updating an application via a `PUT` API call to `/v1/Applications/<app_sid>` led to the removal of `call_hook`, `call_status_hook`, and `messaging_hook`. This  issue occurred when these values weren't included in the request body

### Cognigy Webchat

**Released** August 5, 2025

#### Improvements

- Updated Webchat v3 and Demo Webchat to [v3.28.0](https://github.com/Cognigy/Webchat/releases/tag/v3.28.0)

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** August 5, 2025

#### Improvements

- Enhanced conversation routing. Now, Live Agent reassigns conversations with the status [Snoozed (until next reply)](../live-agent/conversation/conversation-routing/automatic-mode.md) and unassigns them if the human agent has reached their conversation limit

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue that prevented the profile image from displaying in the Contact Profile Details, even when a valid image URL was set

### Cognigy Insights

**Released** August 5, 2025

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where users assigned to many projects had a JWT that exceeded the HTTP header size limit, resulting in authentication failures with a 431 error
