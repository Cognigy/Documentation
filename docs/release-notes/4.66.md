### Infrastructure

#### Cognigy.AI + Insights

The `jobSyncKnowledgeData` is a new cron job that has been introduced to sync Knowledge AI data from MongoDB to Weaviate. This job is disabled by default and can be enabled on demand to allow for the restoration or repair of data in Weaviate. The job is applicable only when running on an environment where Knowledge AI is enabled.

`Repair Mode` - enabling the cron job will sync the data from MongoDB to Weaviate during the configured schedule.

```
jobSyncKnowledgeData:
  enabled: true
  schedule: "0 1 * * *" # every day at 1 AM
```

`Restore Mode` - the job can be configured to restore the data in Weaviate after a complete cleanup of Weaviate by adding the following `JOB_ARGUMENTS` configuration to the `extraEnvVars` variable in the` values.yaml` file.

```
jobSyncKnowledgeData:
  enabled: true
  extraEnvVars:
    - name: JOB_ARGUMENTS
      value: "eyJhY3Rpb24iOiJyZXN0b3JlVmVjdG9yREIiLCJvcmdhbmlzYXRpb25JZHMiOltdLCJwcm9qZWN0SWRzIjpbXSwic3RvcmVJZHMiOltdLCJ0YXNrSWQiOiIiLCJ0cmFjZUlkIjoidHJhY2UtcmVzdG9yZVZlY3RvckRCIiwidXBkYXRlQmF0Y2hTaXplIjo0MH0="
```
