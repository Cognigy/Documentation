## 4.89.3

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** December 3, 2024

#### Improvements

- Added new filtering logic to prevent empty messages from arriving at the handover provider APIs and causing error logs
- Changed the behavior of sending the conversation transcript to Genesys. Now, the transcript is sent in a single message at the beginning of the handover to a human agent. Additionally, you can set up message filtering. These improvements to both handovers: [Genesys Cloud Guest Chat](../ai/escalate/handover-reference/genesys-cloud-guest-chat.md) and [Genesys Cloud Open Messaging](../ai/escalate/handover-reference/genesys-cloud-open-messaging.md)

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where a Flow could not make a second handover after closing the previous one during the same session with Genesys Open Messaging
- Resolved a performance issue that slowed NLU Intent Training

## 4.89.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** November 12, 2024

#### Improvements

- Moved the [Access Control](../ai/administer/access/admin-center/access-control.md) and [Audit Events](../ai/administer/access/admin-center/audit-events.md) pages under the [Admin Center](../ai/administer/access/admin-center/overview.md). Now, all operations for users with the `admin` role are available in a single interface

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the sidebar logo was incorrectly scrolling up when the page was scrolled. Now, the logo remains fixed in place as intended
- Fixed the issue where, in some places in the UI, Projects are referred to as Agents

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** November 12, 2024

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where Advanced Session Parameters were not applied correctly when the AudioCodes Compatibility Mode setting was enabled

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** November 12, 2024

#### Improvements

- Added a general agent-friendly serialization of xApps JSON objects. This improvement helps human agents using Cognigy Live Agent read xApps output in a simplified format instead of raw JSON. In the new format, the JSON syntax is replaced with nested bulleted lists, allowing agents who are unfamiliar with JSON notation to quickly understand the information

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where WhatsApp videos were not being rendered correctly in the conversation chat
- Fixed the issue in the custom date range filter in the Reports. This issue caused the Reports not to update when a single date was selected, and the chart was not visible for the selected date
- Fixed the issue where a human agent, when changing their availability and assigned to multiple inboxes, could receive more conversations than the limit set in the Account Settings
