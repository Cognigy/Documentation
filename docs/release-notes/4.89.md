## 4.89.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** November 12th, 2024

#### Improvements

- Moved the [Access Control](../ai/administer/access/admin-center/access-control.md) and [Audit Events](../ai/administer/access/admin-center/audit-events.md) pages under the [Admin Center](../ai/administer/access/admin-center/overview.md). Now, all operations for users with the `admin` role are available in a single interface

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed the issue where the sidebar logo was incorrectly scrolling up when the page was scrolled. Now, the logo remains fixed in place as intended
- Fixed the issue where, in some places in the UI, Projects are referred to as Agents

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** November 12th, 2024

#### Improvements

- Added a general agent-friendly serialization of xApps JSON objects. This improvement helps human agents using Cognigy Live Agent read xApps output in a simplified format instead of raw JSON. In the new format, the JSON syntax is replaced with nested bulleted lists, allowing agents who are unfamiliar with JSON notation to quickly understand the information

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed the issue where WhatsApp videos were not being rendered correctly in the conversation chat
- Fixed the issue in the custom date range filter in the Reports. This issue caused the Reports not to update when a single date was selected, and the chart was not visible for the selected date
- Fixed the issue where a human agent, when changing their availability and assigned to multiple inboxes, could receive more conversations than the limit set in the Account Settings
