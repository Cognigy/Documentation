# 4.80

!!! warning "Security Changes and their Impact"
    - While addressing security vulnerabilities, changes in third-party vocabularies may cause some exact matching cases to fail, but conversations should continue uninterrupted. Re-training the model will resolve exact matching issues. If persistent errors occur, contact [Cognigy technical support](../help/get-help.md).
    - While addressing security vulnerabilities, changes in third-party vocabularies may cause slight variations in tokenization for certain locales. For example, in French, hyphens may now be included as part of suffixes in tokens. Variations in token outputs are expected. If you encounter any significant issues, contact [Cognigy technical support](../help/get-help.md).

## 4.80.2

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** July 29, 2024

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the Cognigy Live Agent handover was failing and could not transmit any messages

## 4.80.1

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** July 29, 2024

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** July 23, 2024

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the typing status was sent multiple times when the reply box lost focus. For example, this issue would happen if human agents were typing in the reply box and then clicked elsewhere on the page or pressed the Tab key to move to another field

### Infrastructure

**Released** July 10, 2024

#### Cognigy.AI + Insights + AI Copilot

A typo was fixed in the `globalAzureDocumentIntelligenceConfig` attribute in the Cognigy.AI Helm chart.
With the typo corrected,
this release requires the system-wide Azure AI Document Intelligence configuration to be set up as follows:

```yaml
knowledgeSearch:
  enabled: true

  globalAzureDocumentIntelligenceConfig:
    enabled: true
```
#### Cognigy Live Agent 

- Introduced optional PostgreSQL database read replicas to improve infrastructure reliability in high-traffic scenarios

## 4.80.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** July 9, 2024

#### Features

- Added the capability to configure the [Azure AI Document Intelligence](../ai/empower/knowledge-ai/knowledge-source/text-extraction/azure-ai.md) connection for text extraction within the Cognigy.AI UI
- Added the capability to [create a screenshot of the entire Flow](../ai/build/flows/overview.md#chart-controls) and download it in PNG format

#### Improvements

- Added German localization to the product
- Redesigned the Project list in the Cognigy.AI UI for a more convenient way to switch between Projects
- Included the [Max knowledge chunks](../ai/empower/knowledge-ai/activate.md#set-a-quota-via-ui) field in the Change Organisation Quotas section of the management-ui interface
- Added the authorization method [OAuth 2.0 for Microsoft Azure OpenAI](../ai/empower/llms/providers/microsoft-azure-openai.md#add-a-model). Note that this method is experimental and may encounter some issues
- Added the Embedding type of model for custom LLMs
- Implemented the [Stream Reprompt to Output](../ai/build/node-reference/basic/question.md#llm-prompt) option within the LLM Prompt method of the Question Node

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue in the Cognigy.AI OpenAPI documentation where the description of the `entrypoint` parameter was incomplete for [Endpoints](https://api-trial.cognigy.ai/openapi#post-/v2.0/endpoints)
- Fixed the issue of disconnect events not being sent when the [Async Mode](../ai/deploy/endpoint-reference/audiocodes.md#async-mode) setting was enabled in the AudioCodes Endpoint
- Fixed the issue where fetching audit events would result in a detailed error when retrieval fails
- Fixed the issue where skipped or ignored trainer records from Snapshots were not displayed when filtering using Snapshots
- Fixed the issue where conversations could end up in an unresponsive state
- Fixed the issue where `textCleaner` removes the leading zeros from the phrase

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** July 9, 2024

#### Features

- Added the Silence Overlay feature. You can configure this feature in the Voice Gateway Set Session Config Node. This feature allows you to play audio to the caller while the speech input is being transcribed

#### Improvements

- Changed the behavior of the Barge In setting in the Voice Gateway Set Session Config Node for calls transferred to the contact center. Previously, Barge In was always active regardless of its setting. Now, if Barge In is turned off, callers cannot interrupt conversations. If it's turned on, callers can interrupt conversations
- Added support for REGISTER with SIP over TLS using the SIP scheme. Previously, only the SIPS scheme was supported. Now, SIP is the default for all new Carriers; existing ones remain the SIPS scheme. If you want to add encryption to make outbound calls more secure, activate the use of SIPS in the Voice Gateway Self-Service Portal by navigating to Carriers > SIP Gateways > Use sips scheme

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the `TRANSFER_REFER_SUCCESS` event was missing after a successful `REFER` with `final_referred_call_status: 410 (Gone)`. This event is now properly handled, including a correct value for handover escalations (Analytics)
- Fixed the issue where an error log was generated when `REFER` with `final_referred_call_status: 410 (Gone)` occurred
- Fixed the issue where a timeout is triggered when a message is sent to Cognigy.AI. The issue happens in scenarios where no response was expected. The solution now ensures the timeout is only triggered when `ENDPOINT_VG2_TIMEOUT_FOR_AI_RESPONSES_IN_SECONDS` is set
- Fixed the issue where the code was missing to support testing STT for on-premises Microsoft speech service with a private endpoint
- Fixed the issue where the default model for speech-to-text using Google was incorrect. Leading to possible unsupported languages
- Fixed the issue of streaming failures with the Microsoft Speech Services provider

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** July 9, 2024

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where removing a human agent from an inbox caused conversations outside of that inbox to be unassigned

### Cognigy Insights

**Released** July 9, 2024

#### Improvements

- Added information about Privacy Policy acceptance to the detailed view of the Transcript Explorer
- Improved by including the [`agentName`](../ai/analyze/odata.md#liveagentescalations) field in the `Live Agent Escalations` model, allowing the OData `LiveAgentEscalations` endpoint to display this information

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where attachments from the Live Agent were shown incorrectly in the Transcript Explorer

### Infrastructure

#### Cognigy.AI + Insights + AI Copilot

##### New Azure AI Document Intelligence Configuration

The mechanism for the system-wide Azure AI Document Intelligence configuration has been updated. The following environment variables are no longer used:

- `FEATURE_ENABLE_AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_ORG_WHITELIST`
- `AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_ENDPOINT`
- `AZURE_DOCUMENT_INTELLIGENCE_APIKEY`

These environment variables, which were configured for `task-process-knowledge-source-file`, should be removed. Instead, the following section should be added under the `knowledgeSearch` section:

```yaml
  globalAzureDocumentIntelligenceConfig:
    enabled: true
```

For example, on a system where the Knowledge AI feature is enabled, the configuration would be the following:

```yaml
knowledgeSearch:
  enabled: true

  globalAzureDocumentIntelligenceConfig:
    enabled: true
```

The `cognigy-azure-ai-document-intelligence-credentials` parameter should be configured to contain the required API key and Endpoint URL.

##### Rollback Instructions

In case you need to revert to a version below 4.80.0, run the following script as we've added new fields to the Project Settings in Cognigy.AI.

1. Establish a connection to the MongoDB instance within your cluster and execute the database script:

    ```
    kubectl exec -it -n mongodb mongodb-0 -- bash
    mongo -u $MONGODB_ROOT_USER -p $MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD --authenticationDatabase admin

    use service-resources;
    db.agentsettings.updateMany({},{$unset:{"generativeAISettings.useCasesSettings.answerExtraction":""}});
    ```

2. Execute the Helm Chart rollback.

#### Cognigy Voice Gateway

- Upgrade `postgres-exporter` to `0.15.0-debian-12-r17`
- Upgrade `postgres` to `14.12.0-debian-12-r15`
