### Webchat Widget

You can find the release notes for our Webchat Widget on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cognigy/WebchatWidget/releases) as usual. The latest release of our Webchat Widget at the time of releasing all other Cognigy products is [v2.49.0](https://github.com/Cognigy/WebchatWidget/releases/tag/v2.49.0).

### Infrastructure

#### Cognigy.AI + Insights

##### Kubernetes version

In this release, Cognigy Helm Chart officially supports Kubernetes 1.24, which is the version most cloud providers offer for fully managed Kubernetes clusters.

##### Redis memory eviction policy

In this release, `maxmemory` and `maxmemory-policy` have been made configurable. The default value for `maxmemory` is `512mb`, and `maxmemory-policy` is `volatile-ttl`.

Redis instances will restart during the upgrade, and the application might not be available for a few minutes.

#### Voice Gateway

In this release, we added support to use static public IP on the SBC-RTP nodes in a EKS cluster.

We have replaced the `spec.values.sbc.ec2EipAllocator.eipGroupRole` with `spec.values.sbc.ec2EipAllocator.sipEipGroupRole`. If you have defined the tags of EIP for `voip_nodes` in `spec.values.sbc.ec2EipAllocator.eipGroupRole`, then use the `spec.values.sbc.ec2EipAllocator.sipEipGroupRole` instead. We have also introduced a new var `spec.values.sbc.ec2EipAllocator.rtpEipGroupRole`.
