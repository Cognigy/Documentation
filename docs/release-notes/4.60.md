### Webchat Widget

You can find the release notes for our Webchat Widget on [Github](https://github.com/Cognigy/WebchatWidget/releases) as usual. The latest release of our Webchat Widget at the time of releasing all other Cognigy products is [v2.56.0](https://github.com/Cognigy/WebchatWidget/releases/tag/v2.56.0).

### Infrastructure

#### Cognigy.AI + Insights

This release of Cognigy.AI brings the following changes to the Cognigy.AI cluster:

- **cron-nfs-cleanup** — a new cron job that cleans up old prepared snapshots every hour from the NFS.
  If necessary, append the following `securityContext` configuration for `serviceApi` in the [values.yaml](https://github.com/Cognigy/cognigy-ai-helm-chart#configuration).

    ```
    serviceApi:
      securityContext:
        fsGroup: 2000 (This value needs to be adjusted according to your infrastructure)
    ```

- **cognigy-oauth-client-secret** — a new secret relevant to the Cognigy UI login.

Starting from this release, you need to follow the rollback instructions below if you want to revert Cognigy.AI to a version older than 4.60:

- Connect to the MongoDB instance running in your cluster and execute the rollback DB script:

    ```
    kubectl exec -it -n mongodb mongodb-0 -- bash
    mongo -u $MONGODB_ROOT_USER -p $MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD --authenticationDatabase admin
    
    use service-api;
    db.oauthclients.deleteOne({"id":"cognigy-ui"}); 
    ```

- Execute the Helm Chart rollback.

#### Cognigy NLU: from V1 to V2

For on-premises Cognigy v4.60 or later, migrating from NLU V1 to NLU V2 is necessary. We have enhanced NLP services for scalability, security, and reliability by dividing them into smaller, independently scalable components. To migrate to the new version, refer to the [Cognigy NLU: from V1 to V2](../ai/installation/migration/from-nlu-v1-to-v2-migration.md) guide.
