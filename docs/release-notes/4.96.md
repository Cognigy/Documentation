# 4.96

!!! warning "Upcoming Feature Deprecations and Removals"
    - [AudioCodes Nodes](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/audiocodes/overview.md) and [Generic Voice Nodes](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/generic/overview.md) have been deprecated. Flows with these Nodes continue to work, and you can still edit and clone them as well as export them as a Package. However, you can't create new ones in Cognigy.AI v4.96 or later.
    - On February 15, 2024, Google deprecated Gemini 1.0 Pro. The shutdown date for this model is April 9, 2025. Google recommends migrating to [Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/deprecations/gemini-1.0-pro) before April 9, 2025. We strongly recommend carrying out this migration since Gemini 1.0 Pro support will be removed from future Cognigy.AI versions.
    - On April 29, 2025, we will discard `say` verbs with `empty text content` affecting the following Voice Gateway Nodes:
        - [Say](../ai/build/node-reference/basic/say.md)
        - [Question](../ai/build/node-reference/basic/question.md)
        - [Optional Question](../ai/build/node-reference/basic/optional-question.md)

      Refer to the list of all upcoming removals on the [Deprecations and Removals](deprecations-and-removals.md) page.

- Introduced a Voice Configuration section to both the [AI Agent Creation wizard](../ai/empower/agentic-ai/manage-ai-agents.md#create-an-ai-agent) and the [AI Agent Node](../ai/build/node-reference/ai/ai-agent.md), allowing users to fully customize voice settings, such as tone and language, for a specific AI Agent and its role. This customization ensures that the AI Agent's voice matches the intended personality, communication style, and tone appropriate for different use cases, enhancing the user experience and conversation quality while reflecting your product brand

#### Improvements

- Added a [limit](../ai/administer/limitations.md) of 100 Cognigy.AI API calls from the Code Node to prevent excessive API usage
- Added caption messages when sending attachments with Genesys Cloud Open Messaging
- Added [Claude 3.7 Sonnet](../ai/empower/llms/model-support-by-feature.md) to the list of available LLMs from Anthropic

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the Interaction Panel didn't show payloads including only data from untrusted Extensions
- Fixed the issue where updating an If Node resulted in a schema validation error
- Fixed the issue where the Knowledge AI chart on the Admin Center's Dashboard had the incorrect wording for Knowledge AI Chunks. The phrase `avaliable Knowledge AI Chunks` was replaced by `consumed Knowledge AI Chunks`
- Fixed the Intent senctence generation process to ensure no extra information is included in the sentences
- Fixed the issue where a packaged Knowledge Chunk contained an embedding vector with reduced dimensions and resulted in a Package import failure
- Fixed the issue where the Adaptive Card generation failed for `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, and `gpt-35-turbo`

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** March 5, 2025

#### Features

- Added the Duration Limit setting to the [Transfer Node](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/transfer.md) and [Voice Gateway Endpoint](../ai/deploy/endpoint-reference/voice-gateway.md) when using dial. With this setting, you set the maximum duration of call, after which the call ends even if the caller is on the line

#### Improvements

- Improved the tooltip text of the Failover Transcribe Enabled setting in the Call Failover section of the [Voice Gateway Endpoint settings](../ai/deploy/endpoint-reference/voice-gateway.md#call-failover)
- Added support for Elevenlabs's model Flash v2.5 for the [Synthesizer (Text-to-Speech)](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/parameter-details.md#synthesizer---text-to-speech)
- Added the capability to transfer the call when an error occurs with the TTS vendor of the [Synthesizer (Text-to-Speech)](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/parameter-details.md#synthesizer---text-to-speech) or [Recognizer (Speech-to-Text)](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/parameter-details.md#recognizer---speech-to-text)
- Added support for Elevenlabs's model Flash v2.5 to `api-server`
- Added the Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) carrier to the `X-Requested-Carrier-Sid` header for the `sip:refer` verb in outbound calls
- Added a maximum time-to-live (TTL) for sessions to ensure stale sessions are cleaned automatically. This enhances the overall system robustness and reduces potential memory leaks

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the model from the Synthesizer (Text-to-Speech) wasn't applied when using Elevenlabs as a TTS vendor
- Fixed the issue where a call's duration was set to `undefined`, which resulted in the error `Value is not a valid number: undefined`. An explicit validation for `duration` was added before invoking `metricCallSessionDuration.set` when a call is completed
- Fixed the issue where the Refer message could include a Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) contact address when the far end of a call used a Secure Inter-Session Protocol (SIPS). A requirement was added so that the Refer message includes a SIPS contact address rather than SIP
- Fixed the issue in `sbc-outbound` where outbound calls couldn't be transferred using `REFER`
- Fixed the issue in sbc-outbound where interoperability occurred between SIP and SIPS (Secure SIP) communications. As a result, `REFER` messages now include a SIPS contact header when the far-end endpoint uses SIPS
- Fixed the issue where the second `INVITE` request was sent to the incorrect socket during outbound calls
- Fixed the issue where the occurrence of a `CALL_COMPLETED` event during a dial transfer turned all other events into `CALL_COMPLETED` or `CALL_CREATED`
- Fixed the issue where the Silence Overlay settings couldn't be saved in the Set Session Config Node

### Cognigy Webchat

**Released** March 4, 2025

#### Improvements

- Added the Persistent menu to [Webchat v3](../webchat/v3/configuration.md#persistent-menu) and the corresponding settings to the [Webchat v3 Endpoint](../ai/deploy/endpoint-reference/webchat.md) settings
- Added the capability to handle [typing indicators](../webchat/v3/configuration.md#webchat-behavior) for Genesys Cloud Open Messaging and display when a human agent is typing in Webchat
- Added support for new [Webchat v3 settings](../webchat/v3/configuration.md#persistent-menu) mode: Webchat v3 can be configured to [render Markdown, collate streamed output messages, and display messages as progressive stream](../webchat/v3/configuration.md#webchat-behavior)

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the message collation didn't show the header for empty messages

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** March 5, 2025

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the email transcripts and notifications sent with the [Send conversation by email function](../live-agent/assistants/ai-copilot-bot.md#send-a-transcript-to-assigned-agents) weren't displaying the `Powered by Cognigy.AI` label correctly due to missing data for brand name and incorrect logo

### Cognigy Insights

**Released** March 5, 2025

#### Improvements

- Added the Content Security Policy header to the HTML of the Insights to prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) attacks
- Renamed Goals Completed to Tasks Completed in the [Contact Profile details](../insights/explorers/transcript.md#contact-profile-details) and the Transcript Explorer for consistency and better alignment with the [Task](../ai/analyze/goals-and-tasks/tasks.md) feature
- Added Endpoint icons to the [Transcript Explorer](../insights/explorers/transcript.md)
- Added new geographical analytics queries to track user location by city and country
- Added a tooltip with Channel information to the Endpoint icon in the [Transcript Explorer](../insights/explorers/transcript.md) and removed Channel column
- Added the `Top` and `Bottom` filter to the detailed view of the Goals performance chart, increased the displayed Goals from 5 to 10 in the Goals charts, added labels and a white border to the chart bars, and applied Goals filter to the Goals performance chart

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where Goals metrics with a value of 0 were displayed on the legend of the Time Saved chart
- Fixed the issue where the Transcript Explorer showed an incorrect timestamp for time zones observing the daylight saving time
- Fixed the issue where the timestamp filters with time zone offsets weren't handled correctly in OData queries
- Fixed the issue where the Playbook runs failed with a `type` validation error
- Fixed the issue where the Goals performance chart displayed the incorrect total count in the tooltip
- Fixed the issue where the Transcript Explorer detailed view displayed an error for time zones observing the daylight saving time
- Fixed the issue where the OData Steps Endpoint returned incomplete data. Added the missing `id` field to the OData Step data
- Fixed the issue where Transcript Explorer broke if a Slot wasn't matched correctly

### Infrastructure

#### Cognigy Voice Gateway

- Set FreeSWITCH `{{"{{ .Values.freeswitch.args }}"}}` to `- --codec-answer-generous`:  
    FreeSWITCH prioritizes the incoming call's preferred codec, even if it's not the most efficient for FreeSWITCH. FreeSWITCH supports the following audio codecs:
    - PCMU (G.711 μ-law) - 64 kbps, low CPU usage, no compression
    - PCMA (G.711 A-law) - 64 kbps, low CPU usage, no compression
    - OPUS - Variable bitrate (6-510 kbps), excellent quality, higher CPU usage
    - G722 - 64 kbps wideband, good quality, moderate CPU usage
