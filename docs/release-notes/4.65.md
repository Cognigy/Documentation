#### Cognigy.AI + Insights

##### Deprecation of Single Replica Redis

Starting from Cognigy.AI release v4.65,
the Single Replica Redis setup is deprecated and replaced with Redis in High Availability (HA) Mode.

If you are using on-premises installations,
make sure to perform the [Redis: Single Replica to Redis HA Migration](../ai/installation/migration/single-replica-redis-to-redis-ha-migration.md) guide before upgrading to Cognigy.AI v4.65.

##### Knowledge AI Data Migration to MongoDB

Added a job to migrate Knowledge AI data from Weaviate to MongoDB. This job is enabled by default. To continue using the Knowledge AI feature, it's important not to skip this release.

Note that this job can be disabled if you have not yet purchased a license to use Knowledge AI. Refer to the snippet below, which can be configured in `values.yaml`. To disable it, set `enabled: false` as shown in the snippet. This job is temporary; once the migration is complete, it can be disabled.

```yaml
migration:
  kaiEmbeddingMigration:
    enabled: false
    # hooks: post-upgrade
    # hookDeletePolicy: "before-hook-creation"
    # image: cognigy.azurecr.io/kai-embedding-migration:380586885cf71f51c0ae9859cd134eca63de9cd3
    # ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 100
```

##### Deletion or Migration Job for Legacy Endpoints

Added a default job to delete or move old endpoints that are no longer supported. This job removes all Google and Twilio Autopilot Endpoints.
Note that you need to disable this job for fresh installations in `values.yaml`.
To disable it, set `enabled: false` as shown in the snippet below.
This job is temporary; once the migration is complete, it can be disabled.

```yaml
migration:
  endpointDeletion:
    enabled: false
    # hooks: pre-upgrade
    # hookDeletePolicy: "before-hook-creation"
    # ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 900 # 15 minutes
    # affinity: {}
    # image: cognigy.azurecr.io/endpoint-deletion:18539e1e00749e46714614e6e180f2c045bad5cf
    # batchSize: 100
```
