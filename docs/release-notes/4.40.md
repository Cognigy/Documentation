### Cognigy.AI

**Released** November 29, 2022

- Improved the UX of the Voice Preview Dialog
- Improved by updating the Webchat Widget to latest version (v2.44.0)
- Improved by allowing to navigate Positive/Negative confirmation words using Enter key
- Improved by adjusting the generic Voice Flow Nodes "Barge In" and "Play"

#### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a bug where when using a Think node in a flow with Complete Goal nodes defined, these goals were not available in the OData Sessions endpoint.
- Fixed a bug where an Execute Cognigy NLU node would not trigger an intent's default reply. An new option Process Intent Default Reply has been added to the Execute Cognigy NLU node. This option is disabled by default, which means the default reply is not processed. However, when it is enabled, the default reply is processed in the same manner as when triggered by means other than the Execute Cognigy NLU node.
- Fixed a bug where execution count for realtime translation with DeepL did not work properly for English and Portuguese.
- Fixed a bug where English money slots would sometimes be recognized as date slots.
- Fixed a bug where service-parser would crash when importing Keyphrases with an empty data object.
- Fixed a bug where CognigyScript in lookup Nodes would log errors.
- Fixed a bug where the media file attached from WhatsApp endpoint is not visible in the interaction panel during a live-follow
- Fixed a bug where voice name and language gets reset after audio provider is changed

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** November 29, 2022

#### Improvements

- Fixed a bug where the translations in the success message for updating agents inside an inbox was not displayed correctly

### Webchat Widget

You can find the release notes for our Webchat Widget on [GitHub](https://github.com/Cognigy/WebchatWidget/releases) as usual. The latest release of our Webchat Widget at the time of releasing all other Cognigy products is [v2.44.0](https://github.com/Cognigy/WebchatWidget/releases/tag/v2.44.0).

### Infrastructure (AI + IN)

#### Stateful services
To improve the functionality and fix known security vulnerabilities in the dependencies of Cognigy.AI/Cognigy Insights uses, we have updated the following dependencies:
- RabbitMQ, from `v3.9.20` to `v3.9.24`

**Important: Once you have upgraded to the new release containing the new RabbitMQ version, run the following command to rollout (restart) all Pods that run in your cluster - be sure to replace the <target_namespace> accordingly:**

{% raw %}

```bash
for i in $(kubectl get deployment --namespace <target_namespace> --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'|grep service-)
do
kubectl --namespace <target_namespace> rollout restart deployment $i
done
```

{% endraw %}

#### New service
This release also adds a new service called `service-collector`. This microservice will be used in the neare future to collect analytics information for Cognigy Insights so we can also ingest data from other Cognigy products such as Cognigy Live Agent and Cognigy Voice Gateway.

**Important: In case you have overwritten the replica-count (or other aspects) for specific services in your own `values` file, make sure that you also apply the same configuration for the new `serviceCollector` section in your `values`.**

#### Config change
In case you are already using the `call capabilities within the Cognigy.AI Interaction Panel`, you have to make sure that you change the following ENV variable in the `cognigyEnv` configmap section:
```
VOICE_GATEWAY_PREPARE_CALL_API
```

from value: `/api/v1/call/prepare` to value: `/api/v2/call/prepare`.

In addition, you have to set the following ENV variable so `Cognigy Live Agent` will be able to display attachments that have been uploaded through Cognigy.AI endpoints:
```
RUNTIME_FILE_MANAGER_CORS_WHITELIST
```

the value should be at least set to the `frontend DNS name` of the `Cognigy Live Agent` installation - an example value would be: `https://dev-live-agent.cognigy.ai`
