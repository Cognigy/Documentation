#### Cognigy.AI + Insights

If you are not using `cognigyLiveAgent.existingSecret` in your `values` local file, then you need to add the `helm.sh/resource-policy: keep` annotation to the `cognigy-live-agent-credentials` secret. 
You can do this by using the following command. Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace where Cognigy.AI is deployed.

```bash
kubectl annotate -n=<namespace> secret cognigy-live-agent-credentials helm.sh/resource-policy=keep
```
