## 4.100.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** April 29, 2025

#### Features

##### Amazon EventBridge Integration for Genesys Cloud Open Messaging

Implemented a new integration using [Amazon EventBridge for Genesys Cloud Open Messaging](../ai/escalate/handover-reference/genesys-cloud-open-messaging-with-amazon-eventbridge.md) to receive `UserEndEvent` and `AfterCallWorkEvent` events from Genesys, improving the reliability of conversation events.

- Implemented pre-aggregation of conversation counters, phased out of version 2 of the API routes for getting conversation counters, and introduced [version 3 of these API routes](https://api-trial.cognigy.ai/openapi#get-/v3.0/conversationcounter). The new API version improves the performance of conversation count retrieval for billing
- Added handover errors logs to **Test > Logs**
- Added [backward compatibility](../ai/analyze/goals-and-tasks/tasks.md#profilegoals-your-compatibility-alias-to-profiletasks) for `profile.goals`. Now, `profile.goals` points to `profile.tasks`, ensuring compatibility with all Flows
