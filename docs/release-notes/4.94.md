# 4.94

!!! warning "Required Update to 4.94 for On-Prem Customers"
    On-premises customers must add the `TMP_USE_LEGACY_NODE_DATA_VALIDATION: "true"` environment variable to the Cognigy.AI
    `values.yaml` when updating to version 4.94.

!!! warning "Upcoming Feature Deprecations and Removals"
    - [AudioCodes Nodes](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/audiocodes/overview.md) and [Generic Voice Nodes](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/generic/overview.md) will be deprecated with the release of Cognigy.AI 4.96, on March 4, 2025. After this date, you won't be able to create these types of Nodes, but you can still edit or clone existing ones. Flows with these Nodes continue to work after the deprecation date.
    - On February 15, 2024, Google deprecated Gemini 1.0 Pro. The shutdown date for this model is April 9, 2025. Google recommends migrating to [Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/deprecations/gemini-1.0-pro) before April 9, 2025. We strongly recommend carrying out this migration since Gemini 1.0 Pro support will be removed from future Cognigy.AI versions.
    - On April 29, 2025, we will discard `say` verbs with `empty text content` affecting the following Voice Gateway Nodes:
        - [Say](../ai/build/node-reference/basic/say.md)
        - [Question](../ai/build/node-reference/basic/question.md)
        - [Optional Question](../ai/build/node-reference/basic/optional-question.md)

    Refer to the list of all upcoming removals on the [Deprecations and Removals](deprecations-and-removals.md) page.

## 4.94.1

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** February 17, 2025

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the error related to GE-ge localization when using the Voice Gateway Endpoint

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** February 14, 2025

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where a call duration metric was recorded even before the call finished, causing the `TypeError: Value is not a valid number: undefined` error. This issue didn't affect actual calls but polluted the monitoring stack

## 4.94.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** February 4, 2025

#### Improvements

- Changed log sorting to be based on `_id` instead of `timestamp`
- Enhanced the form validation in Manage > Settings by expanding collapsed sections where required input is missing
- Added validation to the UI for the AI Agent name field
- Added support for using triggers, workflows, and web services data actions to detect when a Genesys Open Messaging conversation has ended. This mode needs to be enabled with a feature flag, and the necessary resources on the Genesys side must be created to trigger the actions
- Changed the logic to detect handover ending on Genesys Open Messaging in a more reliable way by using different notification API topics
- Provided the updated link to documentation on how to embed Webchat v3

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue in `feature-server` where empty Say Nodes resulted in the call being terminated
- Fixed the issue where the fallback transfer of an application was not working for calls initiated via the API

### Cognigy Webchat

### Cognigy Insights

**Released** February 4, 2025

#### Improvements

- Renamed Contact ID to [User ID](../insights/explorers/transcript.md#list-of-sessions) to synchronize naming conventions across Cognigy products
