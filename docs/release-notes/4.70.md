## 4.70.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** February 20, 2024

#### Improvements

- Added the Custom URL field to [Aleph Alpha LLM configuration](../ai/empower/llms/providers/aleph-alpha.md#add-a-model)
- Made package uploads more user-friendly by keeping extracted content when navigating during the upload process
- Improved the [LLM Prompt](../ai/build/node-reference/service/llm-prompt.md) Node by adding JSON Mode, detailed results storage, stream copy storage, seed parameters, and custom options
- Improved by [forwarding custom attributes](../ai/escalate/handover-reference/genesys-cloud-open-messaging.md#configure-handover-settings), including queue, languages, skills, and manually defined attributes, into the Genesys inbound message flow. This data can be retrieved by using the [Get Participant Data action](https://help.mypurecloud.com/articles/get-participant-data-action/) in the Genesys flow design

- Fixed the issue with double submission and inconsistent template-changing behavior in xApps
- Fixed the issue where Voice Gateway incorrectly assigned the user ID when placing outbound calls
- Fixed the issue where the selected voice in the TTS settings of an old Set Session Config Node was missing
- Fixed the issue where selecting Execute Flow as an Action in the Call Events setup of the Voice Gateway Endpoint did not require Flow selection, leading to execution issues
