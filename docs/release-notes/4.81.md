!!! warning "Security Changes and their Impact"
    - While addressing security vulnerabilities, changes in third-party vocabularies may cause some exact matching cases to fail, but conversations should continue uninterrupted. Re-training the model will resolve exact matching issues. If persistent errors occur, contact [Cognigy technical support](../help/get-help.md).
    - While addressing security vulnerabilities, changes in third-party vocabularies may cause slight variations in tokenization for certain locales. For example, in French, hyphens may now be included as part of suffixes in tokens. Variations in token outputs are expected. If you encounter any significant issues, contact [Cognigy technical support](../help/get-help.md).
