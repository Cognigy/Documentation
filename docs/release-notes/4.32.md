### Infrastructure (AI + IN)

#### Stateful services

To improve the functionality and fix known security vulnerabilities in the dependencies Cognigy.AI/Cognigy Insights uses, we have updated the following dependencies:

- Redis, from `v5.0.8` to `v5.0.14`
- RabbitMQ, from `v3.8.3` to `v3.9.20`

In addition, we have released a new version of our `MongoDB Helm Chart` which you can use to deploy a 3-node MongoDB replica-set. We have increased the MongoDB version from `v4.2.5` to `v4.2.21` in this new Helm Chart. For more info, [see](https://github.com/Cognigy/cognigy-mongodb-helm-chart).

Updating to this release requires you to update these `stateful services`. Doing this will require restating all application Pods and will come with a couple of seconds of downtime. In order to restart all Pods after you have updated MongoDB, RabbitMQ, Redis and Redis-persistent, you can use the following command:

{% raw %}

```bash
for i in $(kubectl get deployment --namespace <target_namespace> --template '{{range .items}}{{.metadata.name}}{{"\n"}}{{end}}'|grep service-)
do
kubectl --namespace <target_namespace> rollout restart deployment $i
done
```

{% endraw %}

Be sure to replace the `<target_namespace>` with e.g. something like `cognigy-ai`.

#### NLU services - optional

In order to avoid that you need to provision unnecessary resources in your Kubernetes clusters, we now require you to select which `NLU languages` you actually need in your Cognigy.AI setup. If you, for instance, want to only build bots in English language, you can activate English NLU by doing the following in your `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
## Enable your choice of NLU service by following the below example
serviceNlpScoreEn:
  enabled: true
serviceNlpTrainEn:
  enabled: true
```

#### New services

You will also see that this release introduces two new microservices:

- service-insights-ui
- service-insights-api

We are slowly separating Cognigy.Insights from Cognigy.AI in order to improve scalability, stability and performance of both products. To prepare your installation, follow these steps closely in order to make sure that the upgrade is smooth:

Create a new DNS entry for `service-insights-api` and point it towards your loadbalancer which was provisioned when you have installed Cognigy.AI. A potential example would be the following:

Let's assume that your `Cognigy.AI API` is available on the DNS name `api-trial.cognigy.ai` a good name for the new Insights API service would be `insights-api-trial.cognigy.ai` - so we e.g. just prefix the Cognigy.AI API address with `insights-`.

Using a command like `dig` on Linux should reveal that both DNS names point to the same Loadbalancer address:

```
dig api-trial.cognigy.ai

```

Performing the same `dig` command for the new Insights API server should return similar data.

The last step is to make sure that you add the following key/value pair to the `cognigyEnv` section of your `values.yaml` file:

```yaml
FEATURE_USE_SERVICE_INSIGHTS_UI: "true"
```
