# 2025.15

!!! warning
    - On June 30, 2025, Anthropic deprecated `claude-3-opus`. The expected removal date for this model is January 2026. [Anthropic recommends migrating](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/about-claude/model-deprecations) to `claude-opus-4-0` before January 2026. We strongly recommend carrying out this migration since `claude-3-opus` support will be removed from future Cognigy.AI versions.

    Refer to the list of all upcoming removals on the [Deprecations and Removals](deprecations-and-removals.md) page.
