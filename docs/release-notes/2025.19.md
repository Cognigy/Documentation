## 2025.19.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** September 16, 2025

#### Features

##### Enhanced AI Agent Job and Tool Management

Introduced a sleek, user-friendly interface for [managing AI Agents' jobs and tools](../ai/empower/agentic-ai/manage-ai-agents.md), with Flow Logic for AI Agents accessible via the Advanced Editor button, making workflows more intuitive and easier to configure.

#### Improvements

- Added the `message id` key to the [`transcript`](../ai/build/ai-agent-memory/input.md#nested-objects) Input object to uniquely identify each message within a conversation transcript
- Added a loading banner to show progress when creating Knowledge Sources
- Added the End Handover on Participant Change setting to the Handover to Agent Node for the Salesforce MIAW provider. Enabling this setting ends the handover when an agent is removed, relying on the participant change event because [Salesforce can't always guarantee receipt](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000397177&type=1) of the conversation close event

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where pressing backspace in the JSON editor of an Agent Copilot Grid Node redirected the screen to the Flow editor
- Fixed the issue where configuring OAuth credentials in a Genesys Endpoint failed with the error `Validation failed. Field oAuth2Connection was not allowed`
- Fixed the issue in the Endpoint settings where password managers were automatically filling the Client Secret field in the Handover Settings section for Genesys Cloud Open Messaging
- Fixed the issue in the Endpoint settings where Macedonian wasn't correctly translated when auto-detection was enabled in the Real Time Translation Settings section
- Fixed the issue where design-time features didn't work with `gpt-4` family models, `claude-sonnet-4-0`, and `claude-opus-4-0` models
- Fixed the issue where tools from child AI Agent Nodes placed below a Tool Node were also returned as part of the parent Agent's tools, causing them to appear in both lists. The endpoint now returns only the jobs that belong to the specified parent `agentId`
- Fixed the issue where user IDs with big integer values weren't processed correctly during handover

### Cognigy Webchat

**Released** September 16, 2025

#### Improvements

- Updated Webchat v3 and Demo Webchat to [v3.30.1](https://github.com/Cognigy/Webchat/releases/tag/v3.30.1)

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** September 16, 2025

#### Improvements

- Added the [TTL for conversations](../live-agent/settings/account-settings.md#ttl-for-conversations) to the Account Settings, allowing automatic deletion of old conversations from the UI and the Live Agent OData Endpoint

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where Japanese translations were incomplete in the UI. Now all strings are fully translated
- Fixed the issue where activity messages about conversation assignments weren't translated to the account locale
- Fixed the issue where auto-assigned conversations to an online agent were treated as self-assignments, causing email notifications to be skipped

### Cognigy Insights

**Released** September 16, 2025

#### Improvements

- Enhanced Playbook text assertions with [advanced fuzzy search](../ai/test/assertions.md) that handles case differences, extra spaces, tabs, newlines, and escaped characters
- Removed the charts related to the understood/misunderstood message concept from the Overview and NLU Performance reports to simplify the reports and focus on more actionable metrics
- Removed the Top Tasks chart from the Engagement report because the chart was already included in the Overview report, avoiding duplication and improving clarity

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where Voice Gateway messages didn't show up in the Transcript Explorer
- Fixed the issue where the Playbook editor execution didn't store Analytics data
- Fixed the issue where Insights failed to load due to a missing role during validation
