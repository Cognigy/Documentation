### Infrastructure

#### New services

This release includes Cognigy xApps in a public beta, with xApps microservices being deployed by default. Upgrading to this release will:

- add two new Kubernetes Deployments `serviceAppSessionManager` and `serviceStaticFiles`
- add two new Kubernetes Services for the Deployments (see above)
- add two new Ingress objects for the Pods created by the Deployments (see above)

To configure the Ingress objects mentioned above, you need to create two new DNS entries and point them to your load balancer, which was provisioned during the installation of Cognigy.AI. Here's an example of how you could name those DNS entries if your Cognigy.AI UI is located at trial.cognigy.ai:

- for service-static-files: `static-trial.cognigy.ai`
- for service-app-session-manager: `apps-trial.cognigy.ai`

Ensure that the records have been properly created by using a command line tool such as `dig` on Linux.

The last step is to remove the `cognigyApps.enabled` feature flag from your own `values` file if you have previously added it:

```yml
# This is a temp flag for "Cognigy Apps" which will be removed once we are done with
# fully finishing this feature. Please don't use this flag for now if you are a
# customer running Cognigy.AI/Cognigy Insights using this HelmChart.
cognigyApps:
  enabled: false
```

This is no longer required, and the condition will not be used even if present.
