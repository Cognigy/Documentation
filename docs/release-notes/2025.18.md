### Cognigy.AI

**Released** September 2, 2025

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the Absorb Context parameter in the Go To Node didn't merge the source and destination Flow contexts as expected
- Fixed the issue in the Cognigy.AI API documentation. Now, GET APIs show the response for the `next` and `previous` cursors
- Fixed the spacing, sizing, and styling issues in the Lexicon and Any Slot input fields to align them with System Slot fields
- Fixed the issue where goals weren't created in Analytics when uploading a Snapshot, which caused missing data in the Goals Performance chart in Insights
- Fixed the issue where users with `projectAdmin` roles couldn't upload a file within the Project they administer. For example, when creating an LLM connection using the Upload JSON File option
- Fixed the issue where users couldn't save CognigyScript expressions in Node fields that support Manual Input, such as the Select Flow and Select Node fields in the Go To Node
- Fixed the issue where the AI Enhanced Output feature failed on Azure-hosted LLMs due to content policy violations
- Fixed the issue where the AI Enhanced Output feature didn't work with the following models: `gpt-4.1`, `gpt-4.1-nano`, `gpt-4.1-mini`, `claude-sonnet-4-0`, `claude-opus-4-0`
- Fixed the issue in the Endpoint settings where the Migrate to Handover Providers button for the Live Agent saved the pre-configured account instead of the manually entered configuration
- Fixed the issue in the Question Node where the Large Language Model list didn't display available models in the following scenarios:
    - When LLM Prompt was selected under Reprompt Options > Reprompt Method
    - When LLM-Extract Entity was selected from the Question Type list, the LLM Entity Extraction Options section showed an empty model list

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** September 2, 2025

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the `termination_reason` field in the Call Detail Record (CDR) for failed calls in `sbc-inbound`. Now, the `caller abandoned` reason correctly indicates that the caller initiated the call but canceled it before it was answered
- Fixed the issue where multiple `BYE` messages were sent when the voice AI Agent hung up a call in `sbc-inbound`. This fix ensures that each call termination generates only a single event, preventing duplicate call termination notifications

### Cognigy Webchat
