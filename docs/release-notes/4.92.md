# 4.92

!!! warning "Deprecation of Google Gemini 1.0 Pro model"
    On February 25, 2024, Google deprecated Gemini 1.0 Pro. The shutdown date for this model is April 9, 2025. Google recommends to migrate to [Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/deprecations/gemini-1.0-pro) before April 9, 2025. We strongly recommend carrying out this migration since Gemini 1.0 Pro support will be removed from future Cognigy.AI versions.

    By default, this capability is disabled. To enable it, set `FEAT_COMPATIBILITY_RFC3261={{ "{{ .Values.sbcOutbound.registerRfc3261 }}" }}`

- Fixed the issue where the fallback transfer by dial or refer didn't hang up when the user line was busy or the user rejects the call

### Infrastructure

#### Traefik: Enable high availability (HA) by default

- **For dedicated and shared SaaS installations:**
To ensure HA, Traefik pods are deployed in 3 Availability Zones (AZ) (Cognigy.AI recommended setup) by default, one pod for each AZ.

**For on-premises installations:**
Traefik HA default settings requires that you run your cluster with 3 AZs (Cognigy.AI recommended setup), and the Helm Release spawns HA replicas across the 3 AZs. If you deploy your cluster without AZs, override the zonal `podAntiAffinity` key in the `values.yaml` file, as follows:

```yaml
traefik:
  deployment:
    # podLabels:
    #   uniquezone: "set"
  affinity:
    podAntiAffinity:
      requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution: []
```

**Note:** In the `values.yaml` file, you can remove the `.traefik.deployment.podLabels.uniquezone` key or comment it out as shown previously
   
#### Cognigy Voice Gateway

- Add the `FEAT_COMPATIBILITY_RFC3261` feature flag to the deployment of `sbc-outbound`. When enabled, the `SIP 'Contact' user` header will be set to the same value as the `SIP 'From' user` header of a carrier. This feature can be enabled by setting `{{ "{{ .Values.sbcOutbound.registerRfc3261 }}" }}` to `true`. By default, `{{ "{{ .Values.sbcOutbound.registerRfc3261 }}" }}` is `false`
- Added the possibility to select Deepgram as an STT vendor and renamed `ENABLE_TTS_DEEPGRAM` flag to `ENABLE_DEEPGRAM` with the `.Values.webapp.enableDeepgram` value
