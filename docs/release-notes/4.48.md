# 4.48 - Happy Easter üêá

_In this release, we have included some new features and improvements. We hope you enjoy them and enhance your experience with Cognigy products. Thank you for choosing Cognigy, and have a wonderful Easter!_

!!! warning "Migration to MongoDB 5"
    As of this release, Cognigy.AI and Cognigy Insights fully support MongoDB 5. Over the next three months, we will migrate all Cognigy-hosted workloads to MongoDB 5. We have already published a new version of our MongoDB HelmChart and encourage you to prepare to migrate to MongoDB 5 as soon as possible. From our first release in July, we will no longer support MongoDB 4.4 and earlier versions.
