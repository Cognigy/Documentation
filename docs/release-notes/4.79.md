## 4.79.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** June 25, 2024

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** June 25, 2024

#### Features

- The feature [Atmosphere Sounds](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/parameter-details.md) adds the possibility to insert additional audio tracks into the conversation. One common usage is to add background sounds of keyboards clicking to simulate an office environment.

    ```ts
    {
        "verb": "dub",
        action: "addTrack" | "removeTrack" | "silenceTrack" | "sayOnTrack" | "playOnTrack";
        track: string;
        play?: string;
        say?: string | object;
        loop?: boolean;
        gain?: number | string;
    }
    ```

#### Improvements

- Audio Pre-Caching is enabled by default. It pre-synthesizes and caches subsequent prompts during playback for seamless transitions.
- Improved by centralizing the definition of the `call_terminated_by` values
- Updated the `vg-speech-utils` service to support `VG_TTS_TRIM_SILENCE_DISABLE_BY_ACC_SID`
- Added a pre-commit hook that performs `npm audit` and `npm run lint:fix` 
- Improved by support SemVer-tagged release images
- Added the maximum waiting time for AI responses through the Voice Gateway. The default value is 30 seconds. It can be adjusted in the Helm charts or Flux Fleet via the environment variable `ENDPOINT_VG2_TIMEOUT_FOR_AI_RESPONSES_IN_SECONDS`

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the `call_termination_by` value was incorrect
- Fixed the issue where, when registering over TLS, the contact header should have an appropriate SIP scheme and port
- Fixed the issue where a non-existent Contact header in 200 OK responses to REGISTER was causing a failure
- Resolved the issue where the incorrect default model was used for Google-based Speech-To-Text conversions, resulting in potential inaccuracies. Transcriptions should now be more accurate by using the `latest_short` model for recognition

### Cognigy Webchat

- Updated Webchat versions:
    - v3: [v3.0.0-beta.30](https://github.com/Cognigy/WebchatWidget/releases/tag/v3.0.0-beta.30)
    - v2: [v2.63.0](https://github.com/Cognigy/WebchatWidget/releases/tag/v2.63.0)

### Cognigy AI Copilot

**Released** June 25, 2024

#### Improvements

- Added the capability to generate Adaptive Cards via Generative AI in the [Copilot: Adaptive Card Tile Node](../ai/build/node-reference/ai-copilot/set-adaptive-card-tile.md)

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** June 25, 2024

#### Improvements

- Improved the performance of the inbox members API endpoints (POST, DELETE, and PATCH) by optimizing them to achieve lower response times and better overall efficiency

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the list of conversations did not get updated in real time when conversations were moved to another inbox, to which the designated agent was not assigned

### Cognigy Insights

**Released** June 25, 2024

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where step explorer in Insights was not showing data when `interaction panel/playbook data` was not checked

### Infrastructure

#### Cognigy.AI + Insights + AI Copilot

##### Rollback Instructions

In case you need to revert to version 4.79.0, run the following script since we've added new fields for the agent settings in the release.

1. Establish a connection to the MongoDB instance within your cluster and execute the database script:

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it -n mongodb mongodb-0 -- bash
    mongo -u $MONGODB_ROOT_USER -p $MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD --authenticationDatabase admin

    use service-resources;
    db.agentsettings.updateMany({},{$unset:{knowledgeAISettings:"",currencySettings:""}});
    ```

2. Execute the Helm Chart rollback.
