### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** June 25th, 2024

#### Improvements

- Audio Pre-Caching is enabled by default. It pre-synthesizes and caches subsequent prompts during playback for seamless transitions.
- Improved by centralizing the definition of the `call_terminated_by` values
- Improved by updating vg-speech-utils to support `VG_TTS_TRIM_SILENCE_DISABLE_BY_ACC_SID`
- Added a pre-commit hook that performs `npm audit` and `npm run lint:fix` 
- Improved by support SemVer tagged release images
- Improved by adding a new parameter `Atmosphere Sounds` to the `Set Session Config` Node. It can be used to insert additional audio tracks into the conversation. One common usage is to add background ambient noise to simulate an office environment.
- Improved by adding a maximum waiting time for AI to respond through Voice Gateway. The default value is 30 seconds. It can be adjusted in the helm charts or flux fleet via the environment variable `ENDPOINT_VG2_TIMEOUT_FOR_AI_RESPONSES_IN_SECONDS`. 

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed the issue where the `call_termination_by` value was incorrect
- Fixed the issue where, when registering over TLS, the contact header should have an appropriate SIP scheme and port
- Fixed the issue where non-existing Contact header in 200 OK response to REGISTER was leading to a crash
