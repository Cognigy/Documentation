  Features: Question Node Slot mapping, Question Node LLM reprompting, Sentiment Analysis.<br>
  This retry mechanism can be controlled using the following environment variables: `GENERATIVE_AI_RETRY_OPTIONS_NUMBER_OF_RETRIES`, `GENERATIVE_AI_RETRY_OPTIONS_MIN_TIMEOUT`, `GENERATIVE_AI_RETRY_OPTIONS_MAX_TIMEOUT`, `GENERATIVE_AI_RETRY_OPTIONS_FACTOR`

### Infrastructure

#### Cognigy.AI

##### Migration from Weaviate to Qdrant

In version 4.75, the Weaviate vector database has been removed. If you have a Cognigy on-premises installation and are utilizing the [Knowledge AI features](../ai/empower/knowledge-ai/overview.md), switch to Qdrant before upgrading to version 4.75.0. For a smooth migration, follow the [provided guide](../ai/installation/migration/from-weaviate-to-qdrant.md).

The migration has a side effect that alters the `distance` value. Decision-making in the Flow will be ineffective post-migration if distance is used. If you are using this value in your Flows, refer to [recommendations](../ai/empower/knowledge-ai/distance-value-change-after-migration.md) for configuring this value.

The version compatibility matrix was updated for the following Cognigy products:

- [Cognigy.AI, Insights, and AI Copilot](../ai/installation/version-compatibility-matrix.md)
