#### Features

- [Generative AI Beta](../ai/empower/generative-ai.md) is publicly available for all Cognigy users

### Cognigy Insights

- Added the opportunity for human agents to [create hyperlinks](../live-agent/conversation/send-reply.md#send-a-reply-to-a-user) and sent the hyperlinked text in the conversation chart

### Infrastructure (AI + IN)

#### Redis v7

In this release, we are officially updating the version of Redis we use to Redis 7, which will impact the following two deployments in the Helm Chart:

- statefulRedis
- statefulRedisPersistent

Both Redis instances will restart during the upgrade, and the application might not be available for a few minutes.

!!! warning
    If you are not using the built-in Redis deployments but run Redis outside your Cognigy.AI Helm Chart, make sure to start migrating to Redis 7. Support for Redis 5 has ended, and you will no longer receive any security patches.
