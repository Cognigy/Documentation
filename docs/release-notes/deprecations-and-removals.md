# Deprecations and Removals

Starting with release [4.84](4.84.md), upcoming removals and deprecations are listed on this page.

This page provides a list of removals and deprecations for native Cognigy features,
as well as those that rely on third-party dependencies, such as LLMs (Large Language Models), Endpoints,
and other external connectors.

## Terminology

- **Deprecations**. A feature is considered as outdated and no longer recommended for use, with support limited to critical fixes only. The deprecation process starts with an announcement and continues until the feature is removed in future releases.
- **Removals**. A feature is completely removed and no longer supported after the specified removal date.

## Cognigy Features

The table lists Cognigy features that are deprecated and will be removed in future releases.

## Third-Party Products

The table lists LLMs that are deprecated and will be shut down soon. 
Once the LLM provider removes the model, it will stop working in Cognigy.AI. 
This change could cause disruptions to your AI Agent if the model is still being used in the Flow.
If you've added models from the list as custom models in Cognigy.AI, switch to [newer models](../ai/empower/llms.md#supported-models) before the shutdown date.
