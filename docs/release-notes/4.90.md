## 4.90.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** November 26th, 2024

#### Features

#### Improvements

#### Bugfixes

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** November 26th, 2024

### Features

- Added the `CALL_IN_PROGRESS` call event to monitor the first user input. You can enable this call event in the [Generic Settings endpoint section](../ai/deploy/endpoint-reference/voice-gateway.md#generic-settings)

### Improvements

- Removed the strict validation of audio file URLs that had to end with the `.mp3` extension. Now all MP3 URLs are supported. This applies to audio for [transfer dials](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/transfer.md) and [atmosphere sounds](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/parameter-details/#atmosphere-sounds)
- Set the minimum value for Continuous ASR to `2000ms (2s)`. The value applies to both the [Generic Continuous ASR - Config Node](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/generic/continuous-asr-config.md) and the Continuous ASR in [the Voice Gateway Set Session Config Node](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/set-session-config.md)

### Bugfixes

- Fixed the issue in `sbc-outbound` where DNS resolving for private networking was not working
- Fixed the issue in private networking mode where the `Contact` header contained a public SIP IP instead of the internal one (inbound and outbound calls)
- Fixed the issue where the Flow Input Timeouts list was rendered even with the Set Activity Parameters toggle (Say and Question Nodes) deactivated
- Fixed the issue where the Azure STT Context ID was not applied correctly in the AudioCodes Set Session Parameters and Voice Gateway Set Session Config Nodes
- Fixed the issue in AudioCodes Compatibility Mode where advanced session parameters were not applied correctly in the AudioCodes Set Session Parameters Node

### Security Vulnerabilities

- Fixed security vulnerabilities by updating base image to `22.11-alpine`:
  - api-server 
  - sbc-call-router  
  - sbc-inbound
  - sbc-outbound  
  - sbc-rtpengine-sidecar    
  - sbc-sip-sidecar  
  - vg-alpine-curl
  - vg-billing-app  
  - vg-test-call-manager
  - vg-webapp

### Infrastructure

- Update template of `sbc-sip` container `sbc-sip-sidecar` and environment variable `K8S_POD_IP` which get's passed in the `internal IP` of the pod via `status.podIP`
- Update `vg-drachtio-server` to `0.8.26`
