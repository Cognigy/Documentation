!!! warning "Removal of Several LLM Versions by OpenAI"
    If you are using the `gpt-4-vision-preview`, `gpt-4-1106-vision-preview` OpenAI models as custom models, switch to [newer versions](../ai/empower/llms/model-support-by-feature.md) before the shutdown date (December 6, 2024).

## 4.90.2

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where disabling the Enable Call Event: Call in Progress setting in the Voice Gateway Endpoint did not hide the Call Event Action: Call in Progress section for configuring the handler
- Fixed the issue where accessing a property of the Call in Progress feature caused an error for Endpoints that did not have enabled that feature

## 4.90.1

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** December 3, 2024

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where the `handoverEscalations` field in the Sessions collection of the Analytics database was not updated correctly

### Infrastructure

**Released** November 27, 2024

#### Cognigy Voice Gateway

- Reverted the `vg-drachtio-server:0.8.26` server to `vg-drachtio-server:0.8.26-rc4` due to restarts occurring in some handover scenarios

## 4.90.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** November 26, 2024

#### Features

- Introduced the [LLM fallback](../ai/empower/llms/fallback.md) feature to ensure reliability by automatically switching to an alternate model if the main model fails

#### Improvements

- Added a feature flag to activate and deactivate the OAuth2 connection type for the [Azure OpenAI provider](../ai/empower/llms/providers/microsoft-azure-openai.md)
- Granted users with the `fullSupportUser` role access to view [Audit Events](../ai/administer/access/admin-center/audit-events.md)
- Renamed the Fallback Text field to Textual Description in [Say Nodes](../ai/build/node-reference/basic/say.md)
- Resolved a performance issue that slowed NLU Intent Training
- Renamed the [Complete Goal](../ai/build/node-reference/analytics/complete-task.md) Node to Complete Task and changed Goals to Tasks on the Insights Overview and Engagement dashboards
- Changed the behavior of sending the conversation transcript to Genesys. Now, the transcript is sent in a single message at the beginning of the handover to a human agent. Additionally, you can set up message filtering. These improvements to both handovers: [Genesys Cloud Guest Chat](../ai/escalate/handover-reference/genesys-cloud-guest-chat.md#) and [Genesys Cloud Open Messaging](../ai/escalate/handover-reference/genesys-cloud-open-messaging.md)

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue where a tokenization mismatch between multiple internal services caused some system Slots to not be detected
- Fixed the issue where messages generated by a Code Node caused the handover to fail due to mismatched message shapes
- Fixed the issue where some Node names were causing the incorrect Node type to be displayed
- Fixed the issue where the Channel configuration couldn't be deleted from Say Nodes
- Fixed the issue where a Flow could not make a second handover after closing the previous one during the same session with Genesys Open Messaging

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** November 26, 2024

#### Features

- Added the [`CALL_IN_PROGRESS`](../voice-gateway/references/events/CALL_IN_PROGRESS.md) call event to monitor the first user input. You can enable this call event in the [Generic Settings](../ai/deploy/endpoint-reference/voice-gateway.md#generic-settings) section of the Endpoint Settings

#### Improvements

- Added the capability to anchor media when transferring via dial to help resolve NAT problems, enforce media security policies, and perform media transcoding and monitoring. You can enable this in the [Voice Gateway Endpoint Settings](../ai/deploy/endpoint-reference/voice-gateway.md#call-failover) (Call Failover > Anchor Media) or [Voice Gateway Transfer Node](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/transfer.md) (Advanced > Anchor Media)
- Changed the audio file URL format requirement in the [Voice Gateway Transfer Node](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/transfer.md) (General settings > Dial Music) and [Set Session Config Node](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/parameter-details.md) (Atmosphere Sounds > URL). MP3 URLs no longer need to end with the `.mp3` extension
- Set the minimum value for Continuous ASR to 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds). The value applies to both the [Generic Continuous ASR - Config Node](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/generic/continuous-asr-config.md) and the Continuous ASR in the [Voice Gateway Set Session Config Node](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/parameter-details.md)

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue in `sbc-outbound` where DNS resolving for private networking was not working
- Fixed the issue in private networking mode where the `Contact` header contained a public SIP IP instead of the internal one (inbound and outbound calls)
- Fixed the issue with the display of the Flow Input Timeout section when the Set Activity Parameters setting was disabled, while selecting the Voice Gateway channel in the Say and Question Node editors
- Fixed the issue where the Azure STT Context ID was not applied correctly in the AudioCodes Set Session Parameters and Voice Gateway Set Session Config Nodes

### Cognigy Insights

**Released** November 26, 2024

#### Bug Fixes

### Infrastructure
