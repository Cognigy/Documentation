#### Bugfixes

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** November 26th, 2024

### Features

- Added the `CALL_IN_PROGRESS` call event to monitor the first user input. You can enable this call event in the [Generic Settings endpoint section](../ai/deploy/endpoint-reference/voice-gateway.md#generic-settings)

### Improvements

- Changed the audio file URL format requirement in the [Voice Gateway Transfer Node](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/transfer.md) (General settings > Dial Music) and [Set Session Config Node](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/parameter-details/#atmosphere-sounds) (Atmosphere Sounds > URL). MP3 URLs no longer need to end with the `.mp3` extension.
- Set the minimum value for Continuous ASR to `2000ms (2s)`. The value applies to both the [Generic Continuous ASR - Config Node](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/generic/continuous-asr-config.md) and the Continuous ASR in [the Voice Gateway Set Session Config Node](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/set-session-config.md)
