!!! warning "Upcoming Feature Deprecations and Removals"
    - [AudioCodes Nodes](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/audiocodes/overview.md) and [Generic Voice Nodes](../ai/build/node-reference/voice/generic/overview.md) will be deprecated with the release of Cognigy.AI 4.96, on March 4, 2025. After this date, you won't be able to create these types of Nodes, but you can still edit or clone existing ones. Flows with these Nodes continue to work after the deprecation date.
    - On February 15, 2024, Google deprecated Gemini 1.0 Pro. The shutdown date for this model is April 9, 2025. Google recommends migrating to [Gemini 1.5 Pro and Gemini 1.5 Flash](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/deprecations/gemini-1.0-pro) before April 9, 2025. We strongly recommend carrying out this migration since Gemini 1.0 Pro support will be removed from future Cognigy.AI versions.

### Cognigy.AI

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** February 18, 2025

#### Improvements

- Improved WebSocket connections by implementing a retry mechanism to handle connection timeouts. The default timeout is 1.5 seconds and with up to 3 connection retries
- Improved WebSocket connections by enabling the keepAlive setting, which keeps the connection active even during periods of inactivity. The keepAlive setting includes logging to help monitor and troubleshoot connection issues more easily
- Improved `sbc-inbound` for handling late media calls. A dynamic Session Description Protocol (SDP) is now generated for inbound calls based on call direction and private IP addresses
- Improved the `sbc-rtpengine-sidecar` component by adding two new metrics for better monitoring RTP stream errors:
    - `sbc_rtpengine_sidecar_decode_error` — tracks errors during decoding of incoming RTP media streams
    - `sbc_rtpengine_sidecar_encode_error` — tracks errors during encoding of outgoing RTP media streams
- Improved the Recent Calls section in the Voice Gateway Self-Service Portal by adding a message at the top of the call recording, informing users that the recorded conversation may not fully reflect the actual call
- Renamed the setting `Perform a fallback transfer if the webhook connection fails` to `Perform a fallback transfer if the "Calling webhook" connection fails` in Voice Gateway Self-Service Portal > Applications to clarify that the fallback applies specifically to the Calling webhook connection

#### Bug Fixes

- Fixed the issue in `api-server` that led to an error when trying to validate or save Azure Cloud Storage credentials twice in Applications > Call Recording Configuration
- Fixed the issue where the Webhook fallback was being incorrectly triggered when placing a call via the API
- Fixed the issue in `sbc-outbound` where always sending the crypto suite in the SDP instead of the DTLS handshake was breaking Twilio outbound calls
- Fixed the issue in `sbc-rtpengine-sidecar` where errors in `vg-rtpengine-client` weren't handled properly, which could cause interruptions or failures in RTP engine operations
- Fixed the issue in Voice Gateway Self-Service Portal > Applications where settings for STT, TTS, and fallback labels weren't retained when switching vendors
