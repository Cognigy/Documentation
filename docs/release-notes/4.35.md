### Infrastructure (AI + IN)

#### New Services

This release contains a new microservice:

- service-runtime-file-manager
- clamd

This new service provides functionality which is currently only used by our new
WhatsApp Cloud Endpoint and allows end-users to upload file attachments such as
images, audio, video and e.g. files like PDF. Once a file has been received, it
will be checked for infections with the "clamd" component.

##### DNS record

You will have to create a new DNS record for `service-runtime-file-manager` as
this is a new microservice which will also be fully exposed to the external/public
network. The DNS record needs to be pointed to your loadbalancer which has been
provisioned when Cognigy.AI was installed initially. The following would be an
example of what this can look like:

Let's assume that your `Cognigy.AI API` is available on the DNS name `api-trial.cognigy.ai`

- a good DNS name for the new microservice would e.g. be `files-api-trial.cognigy.ai` -
- so we have essentially just prefixed the `Cognigy.AI API` address with `files-`.

Using a command like `dig` on Linux needs to reveal that both DNS names (old one and
the new once after you have created it) should point to the same loadbalancer address:

```
dig api-trial.cognigy.ai

```

Make sure that the `dig` command shows similar information after you have provisioned
the new DNS record.

##### Values modifications

Make sure that you also update your `Helm values` and implement the following changes in them:

In the `ingress` section, make sure that you define a `host` for the runtime file manager:

```yaml
serviceRuntimeFileManager:
  host: "files-api-trial.cognigy.ai"
```
