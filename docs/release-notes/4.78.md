# 4.78

{! _includes/release-notes/upcoming-feature-removals.md !}

## 4.78.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** June 11th, 2024

#### Features

- Added charts for monitoring the number of Knowledge Chunks and Queries metrics according to a new license for the Knowledge AI feature. To ingest new Knowledge Sources after the v4.78.0 update, a new license key for the Knowledge AI feature should be updated in the Cognigy.AI installation, and the maximum Knowledge Chunks quota should be allocated for the organization.

#### Improvements

- Added the functionality to record user acceptance of the Privacy Notice within the Contact Profile
- Updated the Webchat v3 `preview` tag to `beta`
- Renamed the Organisation Details page to Admin Center
- Removed the Knowledge AI trial notification from the UI
- Improved the Copilot section in the Endpoint Settings to differentiate between configurations for the AI Copilot Whisper and AI Copilot workspace
- Added support for multiple languages in addition to English
- Increased the size limit of a custom field in the Cognigy.AI OData Endpoint. Now, the maximum length of a custom field is 1024 characters

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed the issue of insufficient input validation enabling HTML injection in notification emails
- Fixed the issue where deleting a connection selected in the HTTP Request Node breaks Node execution, even after setting the authType to `none`
- Fixed the issue where the original user input would be replaced by the text of a Think Node in the Transcript Explorer
- Fixed the issue where an NLU warning was displayed due to an error in merging the NLU result
- Fixed the issue where adaptive cards weren't displaying all container and font styling colors

    kubectl exec -it -n mongodb mongodb-0 -- bash
    mongo -u $MONGODB_ROOT_USER -p $MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD --authenticationDatabase admin
