{! _includes/release-notes/upcoming-feature-removals.md !}

## 4.78.0

### Cognigy.AI

**Released** June 11th, 2024

#### Features

- Added charts for [monitoring the number of Knowledge Chunks and Queries metrics](../ai/administer/access/admin-center.md#knowledge-ai) according to a [new license](../ai/empower/knowledge-ai/activate.md#apply-for-a-license) for the Knowledge AI feature. To ingest new Knowledge Sources after the v4.78.0 update, a new license key for the Knowledge AI feature should be updated in the Cognigy.AI installation, and the maximum Knowledge Chunks quota should be allocated for the organization.

#### Improvements

- Added the functionality to record user acceptance of the [Privacy Notice](../webchat/v3/features.md#privacy-notice) within the [Contact Profile](../ai/analyze/contact-profiles.md#profile-schema)
- Added the [Minimize](../webchat/v3/features.md#controlling-the-chat-window) button at the top of the Chat screen within the Webchat v3 interface 
- Updated the Webchat v3 `preview` tag to `beta`
- Renamed the Organisation Details page to [Admin Center](../ai/administer/access/admin-center.md)
- Removed the Knowledge AI trial notification from the UI
- Improved the Copilot section in the Endpoint Settings to differentiate between configurations for the AI Copilot Whisper and AI Copilot workspace
- Updated the AI Copilot configuration. Adding the AI Copilot config via API is no longer mandatory. In the Copilot section of the Endpoint Settings, you can choose Workspace > None and use a Copilot: Set Grid Node to set up the workspace within your Flow
- Added support for multiple languages in addition to English
- Increased the size limit of a custom field in the Cognigy.AI OData Endpoint. Now, the maximum length of a custom field is 1024 characters

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed the issue of insufficient input validation enabling HTML injection in notification emails

- Fixed the issue where the original user input would be replaced by the text of a Think Node in the Transcript Explorer

### Cognigy Insights

**Released** June 11th, 2024

#### Improvements

- Renamed the term virtual agents to AI Agents and the term agents to human agents in the Transcript Explorer

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed the issue where the Step Explorer was giving the error `Invalid request for Step report. Starting step and containing step do not match any of the steps` when the step report is filtered by `snapshotId`

### Cognigy Live Agent

**Released** June 11th, 2024

#### Improvements

- Added a new queue_details Endpoint for conversations to get information about the conversation queue position

#### Bugfixes

- Fixed an issue where automation rules might not behave as expected because of a race condition during their execution 

### Cognigy Voice Gateway

**Released** June 11th, 2024

### Infrastructure

- Enables the environment variable `VG_TTS_TRIM_SILENCE` by default `.Values.featureServer.trimTts: true`
  This trims trailing silence (zero-amplitude samples) from the end of an audio file (Microsoft TTS only)
- Adds a new environment variable to feature-server to control the trim trailing silence functionality for Microsoft speech services by account_sid. By default, the trimming is enabled and `VG_TTS_TRIM_SILENCE_DISABLE_BY_ACC_SID` is not set. To add an account_sid to the ignore list, add `VG_TTS_TRIM_SILENCE_DISABLE_BY_ACC_SID` to the `extraEnvVars` property as shown below
```
featureServer:
  extraEnvVars:
    - name: VG_TTS_TRIM_SILENCE_DISABLE_BY_ACC_SID
      value: "<account_sid1>,<account_sid2>,..."
```

### Bugfixes

- Fixed the issue where the database schema upgrade was failing due to a non-existing schema
- Fixed the issue where recording audio failed for AWS
- Fixed the issue where Deepgram TTS could fail
- Fixed a possible race condition with Atmosphere Noise 
- Fixed a possible race condition with playing filler noise when idle and waiting for commands
- Fixed dead lock in `say` verb while waiting playback-stop and say verb is killed
- Fixed google race condition `gather`
- Fixed a possible race condition during Dial, when caller hangs up while dial is starting
- Fixed the issue where the ASR timer was not restarted after receiving partial transcript
- Fixed the issue where pre-cache audio was leading to a possible misbehavior
- Fixed the issue in `gather` where empty Deepgram transcript saved incorrectly 
- Fixed the issue where `bargeIn` failed after first time even if `sticky=true`
- Fixed the issue with `bargeIn` where `sticky` only worked twice
- Fixed the issue where a SIPREC session was not cleared

### Improvements

- Supports REGISTER over TLS
- Limits `utterance_end_ms` to (1000,5000) per discussion with Deepgram
- Removed asymmetric flag on offer to B party reinvite as port learning should still happen
- Checks if SIP gateway is in blacklist before sending an outbound call
- Added new Microsoft voices and regions
- Added new Google regions

    ```
    kubectl exec -it -n mongodb mongodb-0 -- bash
    mongo -u $MONGODB_ROOT_USER -p $MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD --authenticationDatabase admin

    use service-resources;
    db.endpoints.updateMany({},{$unset:{"handoverSettings.agentAssistSettings.copilotType":""}});
