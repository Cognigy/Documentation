### Infrastructure

#### Cognigy.AI + Insights + AI Copilot

##### Rollback Instructions

In case you need to revert to version 4.78.0, run the following script since we've added new AI Copilot configuration fields for the Endpoints.

1. Establish a connection to the MongoDB instance within your cluster and execute the database script:

    ```bash
    kubectl exec -it -n mongodb mongodb-0 -- bash
    mongo -u $MONGODB_ROOT_USER -p $MONGODB_ROOT_PASSWORD --authenticationDatabase admin

    use service-resources;
    db.endpoints.updateMany({},{$unset:{"handoverSettings.agentAssistSettings.copilotType":""}});
    ```

2. Execute the Helm Chart rollback.

#### Cognigy Voice Gateway

- Add `VG_DISABLE_DIAL_PAI_HEADER` to `feature-server` StatefulSet and Deployment. It can be controlled via `.Values.featureServer.disableDialPaiHeader`. The default value is `false`.
- Add `PRIVATE_IP_ONLY` to `feature-server` StatefulSet and Deployment, and `sbc-sip` StatefulSet and DaemonSet. It can be controlled via `.Values.drachtio.privateIpOnly`. The default value is `false`.
- Rename `JAMBONES_EAGERLY_PRE_CACHE_AUDIO` to `VG_EAGERLY_PRE_CACHE_AUDIO` in the `feature-server` StatefulSet and Deployment.
- Add `ENABLE_PING_OPTIONS` to the `vg-webapp` deployment.
- Add `.extraEnvVars` to all containers of a template. Optionally, specify a list of extra environment variables to be added to the container.
  Containers:
    - `api-ban`
    - `api-server`
    - `billing-app`
    - `drachtio`
    - `feature-server`
    - `freesSWITCH`
    - `heplify-server`
    - `homer`
    - `rtp-engine`
    - `rtp-engine-sidecar`
    - `sbc-call-router`
    - `sbc-inbound`
    - `sbc-outbound`
    - `sbc-sip-sidecar`
    - `test-call-manager`
    - `webapp`<br>
    Example:
    ```yaml
    myService:
      extraEnvVars:
        - name: FOO
          value: "bar"
    ```
- Rename the `test-call-manager` image from `voicegateway-test-call-manager` to `vg-test-call-manager`.
- Rename the `feature-server` image from `jambonz-feature-server` to `vg-feature-server`.
- Expose the drachtio container metrics port for Prometheus monitoring via `.Values.drachtio.metricsPort`. The default port is `8088`.
- Enable the environment variable `VG_TTS_TRIM_SILENCE`. It can be controlled via `.Values.featureServer.trimTts`. The default value is `true`. This configuration removes trailing silence (periods of no sound) at the end of Microsoft TTS audio files.
- Add a new environment variable to `feature-server` to control the trimming of trailing silence for Microsoft TTS services. By default, the trimming is enabled and `VG_TTS_TRIM_SILENCE_DISABLE_BY_ACC_SID` is not set. If you want to add an account sid to the ignore list, add `VG_TTS_TRIM_SILENCE_DISABLE_BY_ACC_SID` to the `extraEnvVars` property:
    ```yaml
    featureServer:
      extraEnvVars:
        - name: VG_TTS_TRIM_SILENCE_DISABLE_BY_ACC_SID
          value: "<account_sid1>,<account_sid2>,..."
    ```
