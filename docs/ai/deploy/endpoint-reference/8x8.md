## How to Set up

To set up the 8x8 Endpoint, follow these steps:

1. [Configure 8x8 Endpoint](#configure-8x8-endpoint)
2. [Configure 8x8](#configure-8x8)

### Configure 8x8 Endpoint

1. In the left-side menu of your Agent, click **Deploy > Endpoints**.
2. On the **Endpoints** page, click **+ New Endpoint**.
3. In the **New Endpoint** section, do the following:
    1. Select the **8x8** Endpoint type.
    2. Add a unique name.
    3. Select a relevant Flow from the list.
4. Click **Save**.
5. In the Endpoint, go to the **8x8 Setup** settings.
6. Specify a Base URL, API Key, and 8x8-Tenant that you received from the 8x8 server administrator.
7. Copy the URL from the **Endpoint URL** field.
8. _(Optional)_ Activate the **Accept Conversation Active Event** setting. When activated, the setting allows the system to accept and process `CONVERSATION UPDATE` events with the state set as `ACTIVE`. These events will be sent to the Flow for further handling. This setting allows accessing the event payload via the [Input object](../../test/interaction-panel/input.md), which provides relevant information related to the ongoing conversation.
     - If the toggle is activated, the end user doesn't have to send the first message. The bot will automatically start replying.
     - If the toggle is not activated, the end user needs to engage in conversation with the bot first in order to receive a reply.
9. Click **Save**.
