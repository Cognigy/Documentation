### Workplace Recipient ID

This value is the **Recipient ID**, which is obtained from the page URL when a conversation with the workplace bot is taking place. This must be added after it has been installed to your workplace instance.

### Install

Use this button to trigger the installation process of the Cognigy.AI Bot to your workplace instance. A pop-up window will appear and redirect to the workplace bot setup menu.
