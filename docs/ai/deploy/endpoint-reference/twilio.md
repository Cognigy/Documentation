Within our **Cognigy.AI** platform, you're able to connect your Cognigy Agent to your **Twilio** channel by using our Twilio Endpoint. This allows you to build Bots your users can talk to or chat with via SMS.

## Twilio Voice, Twilio SMS / WhatsApp

You can select between **two different types of Twilio Endpoints**:

- *Twilio*, which is the Twilio Voice Endpoint.
- *Twilio SMS*, which allows you to send SMS and WhatsApp messages.

For all Endpoint types, you'll have to obtain a phone number. A short description about how to gather a Twilio phone number can be found on our help center pages listed below. After obtaining a number, you're able to deploy and use a Twilio Endpoint.
