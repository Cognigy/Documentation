## How to Set Up

### Configure on the Cognigy.AI Side

??? info "1. Create a Twilio Endpoint"
    To create a Twilio Endpoint, follow these steps:

    1. Go to **Deploy > Endpoints**. 
    2. On the **Endpoints** page, click **+ New Endpoint**. 
    3. In the **New Endpoint** section, do the following:
        1. Select the **Twilio SMS** Endpoint type.
        2. Specify a unique name.
        3. Select a Flow from the list. Save changes.
    4. In the **Configuration Information** section, copy the Endpoint URL and save it for later use.

### Configure on the Twilio Side

??? info "1. Get a Phone Number"
    1. Open the Twilio Console. Go to the Account Dashboard.
    2. In the left sidebar, select the **Develop** tab, then go to **Phone Numbers > Manage > Buy a Number**. Select the country and ensure the number supports SMS. Activate **SMS**. You can search for area code, for example, 211, which shows numbers available for DÃ¼sseldorf, Germany. Select the number and click **Buy**.
    3. Some phone numbers require you to validate that your company operates in the same city or region. This approach is common for German numbers. To validate the number, read the [Twilio documentation](https://help.twilio.com/) and upload proof of your company registration. The validation process can take up to 3 business days. US numbers don't require this validation.
    4. Go to **Active Numbers**. Select the number, then go to **Voice Configuration**. From the **A call comes in** list, select **Webhook**. In the **URL** field, enter the Cognigy.AI Endpoint URL. Click **Save configuration**. To test the connection, send an SMS to your Twilio number.

??? info "2. Connect Your Twilio Number to WhatsApp"
    1. Go to **Explore Products > Messaging**. 
    2. Select **WhatsApp**. To connect the Twilio number to WhatsApp, your Twilio account must first be approved by WhatsApp.
