## Specific Endpoint Settings

### Voice Gateway Specific Nodes

Cognigy.AI comes with built-in Nodes to control Voice Gateway. See [Voice Gateway Nodes](../../build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/overview.md) for more information.

### SIP Headers

The SIP headers, including any custom headers, are available within the [Input](../../test/interaction-panel/input.md) object. 
You can find them in `input.data` or `input.data.sip.headers`.

### Call Metadata

Voice Gateway identifies information about the caller and adds it to the [Input](../../test/interaction-panel/input.md) object as `input.data.numberMetaData`.

| Prosody Settings                    | Toggle | If the parameter is enabled, this configuration will be used to specify changes to speed, pitch, and volume for the text-to-speech output.                                   |
| Show Best Transcripts Only          | Toggle | If the parameter is enabled, only the best transcript in the input object is accessible, instead of all variations.                                                          |
| Enable Call Event: Call in Progress | Toggle | If the parameter is enabled, the [Call in Progress](../../../voice-gateway/references/events/CALL_IN_PROGRESS.md) toggle appears in the [Call Events](#call-events) section. |

#### Prosody Settings

| Parameter     | Type   | Description                                                                                     |
|---------------|--------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Output Speed  | Number | The change in the speaking rate for the contained text in percentage. Value range: -100 to 200. |
| Output Pitch  | Number | The baseline pitch for the contained text in percentage. Value range: -100 to 200.              |
| Output Volume | Number | The volume for the contained text in percentage. Value range: 10 to 200.                        |

##### Adapting Values for your Chosen Speech Provider

As with all Speech Provider settings, there are certain differences in the use of this feature. Refer to your Speech Provider's documentation first to understand which values to add. An example would be the difference between Microsoft Azure and Google. For Microsoft Azure, users need to specify the `%` by which they would like to increase or decrease from the default settings. For instance, an example value could be `Output Speed -20%`, indicating a `20%` reduction from the default output speed of `100%`, resulting in a new output speed of `80%`. To achieve the same effect with Google, users need to add the final output speed in `%` to the Prosody Settings. For example, `Output Speed 80%` directly displays the new output speed, as with Google; the final output speed is directly added to the settings.

### AudioCodes Compatibility Mode

Allows using both AudioCodes Nodes and Voice Gateway Nodes simultaneously in a Flow.
When this mode is enabled, the system treats Flows with AudioCodes Nodes as if they were Flows with Voice Gateway Nodes.
This mode helps ensure that voice AI agents operate smoothly without interruptions during the transition from AudioCodes to Cognigy Voice Gateway.

To activate the **AudioCodes Compatibility Mode** section, add the `FEATURE_VG_AC_COMPATIBILITY_MODE` feature flag to the Cognigy.AI `values.yaml` file.

For more information, read [Migration from AudioCodes to Voice Gateway](../../../voice-gateway/migrate-from-ac-to-vg.md).

### Call Events

Allows activating call events for a Flow.
Select a call event from the [Voice Gateway Events](../../../voice-gateway/references/events/overview.md) list.
This event that will trigger the action.

If you have configured the same call event in both the Endpoint and the [Lookup](../../build/node-reference/logic/lookup.md) Node, the Endpoint settings will overwrite the Node settings.

#### Call Event Settings

!!! note
    As with all other Endpoint settings, you can't test the Call Events settings within the Interaction Panel.

The destination IP address and port become the IP address and port of the public network. <br> - Incoming data — the source IP address and port become the IP address and port of Voice Gateway. The destination IP address and port become the IP address and port of the PBX system or local telephone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Dial          |

| Deepgram Model                   | Dropdown      | This parameter is active only when Deepgram is selected in the STT Vendor setting. <br><br> Choose a model for processing submitted audio. Each model is associated with a tier. Ensure that the selected tier is available for the chosen STT language. For detailed information about Deepgram models, refer to the [Deepgram documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/model).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Dial          |
| Endpointing                      | Toggle        | This parameter is active only when Deepgram is selected in the STT Vendor setting. <br><br> Deepgram's Endpointing feature watches streaming audio for long pauses that signal the end of speech. When it spots an endpoint, it finalizes predictions and returns the transcript, marking it as complete with the `speech_final` parameter set to `true`.  For detailed information about Deepgram Endpointing, refer to the [Deepgram documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/endpointing).<br><br>The duration for detecting the end of speech is preconfigured with a default value (10 milliseconds). If you want to change this value, use the Endpointing Time setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Dial          |
| Endpointing Time                 | Number        | This parameter is active only when Deepgram is selected in the STT Vendor setting and the Endpointing toggle is enabled. <br><br> Customize the duration (in milliseconds) for detecting the end of speech. The default is 10 milliseconds of silence. Transcripts are sent after detecting silence, and the system waits until the speaker resumes or the required silence time is reached. Once either condition is met, a transcript is sent back with `speech_final` set to `true`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Dial          |
| Smart Formatting                 | Toggle        | This parameter is active only when Deepgram is selected in the STT Vendor setting. <br><br> Deepgram's Smart Format feature applies additional formatting to transcripts to optimize them for human readability. Smart Format capabilities vary between models. When Smart Formatting is turned on, Deepgram will always apply the best-available formatting for your chosen model, tier, and language combination. For detailed examples, refer to the [Deepgram documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/smart-format). <br><br> Note that when Smart Formatting is turned on, punctuation will be activated, even if you have the Disable STT Punctuation setting enabled.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Dial          |
| Google Model                     | Dropdown      | This parameter is active only when Google is selected in the STT Vendor setting.<br><br>Utilizes one of Google Cloud Speech-to-Text transcription models, with the `latest_short` model being the default choice. For a detailed list of Google models, refer to the [Transcription models](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/transcription-model#transcription_models)  section in the Google Documentation. Keep in mind that the `default` value is a Google Model type that can be used if other models don't suit your specific scenario.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Dial          |
| Transcription Webhook            | CognigyScript | The webhook is triggered with an HTTP POST whenever an interim or final transcription is received. If the **STT Vendor** and **STT Language** fields are empty, the system will use the default STT from the [Set Session Config Node](../../../ai/build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/parameter-details.md) (if it exists) or from the [Voice Gateway Self-Service Portal](../../../voice-gateway/webapp/speech-services.md). The parameter supports [CognigyScript](../../../ai/build/cognigyscript.md), allowing it to accept dynamic content. For example, you can specify the URL as follows: `https://test-hook.com?contact={{"{{ci.contact_name}}"}}`. <br><br> Note that if the [Voice Copilot](voice-copilot.md) Endpoint is inactive, you can use any Webhook URL to receive voice call transcripts. However, when the Voice Copilot Endpoint is enabled, ensure that the specified Webhook URL is associated with it for processing. | Dial          |
| STT Label                        | CognigyScript | The alternative name of the vendor is the one you [specify in the Voice Gateway Self-Service Portal](../../../voice-gateway/webapp/applications.md#add-additional-tts-and-stt-vendor). If you have created multiple speech services from the same vendor, use the label to specify which service to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Dial          |
| Audio Stream Selection           | Dropdown      | Select the source of the audio stream: <br> - **Caller/Called** - both the incoming and outgoing audio streams of the caller and the called party. <br> - **Caller** - the incoming and outgoing audio stream of the caller. <br>- **Called** - the incoming and outgoing audio stream of the called party. <br> <br> Ensure that the selected audio stream matches the language specified for transcription. If no audio stream is provided, the system will use the one set in the beginning, which should also match the language specified for transcription.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | Dial          |
| Referred By                      | String        | This parameter is optional.<br><br> This setting allows you to change the original Referred By value, which can be a SIP URI or a user identifier such as a phone number. To define the Referred By value, you can use the following patterns:<br>- **SIP URI** - `sip:[referred-by]@custom.domain.com`. In this case, the entire SIP URI will be sent as the Referred-By header.

## Handover Settings

You can use any [handover provider](../../escalate/handover-reference/overview.md) within the Voice Gateway integration.
The Handover Settings enable your voice agent to route calls to the contact center, ensuring efficient communication and swift access to human assistance. 

In contrast to chatting, communication between actors during a voice call occurs using speech recognition technologies (text-to-speech and speech-to-text).
Using speech-to-text technology, the voice agent sends the conversation script from the end user to the human agent. 
Once the script is received, the human agent can respond using text. 
After that, the voice agent converts the human agent's message to speech using text-to-speech technology. 
Finally, the converted message is sent to the end user.

### Configuration

To activate the Handover Settings,
you need to add a [Handover to Agent](../../build/node-reference/service/handover-to-agent.md) Node in your voice Flow.
This Node transfers the conversation from the voice agent to the human agent.

### Example

In this example, an end user seeks billing assistance and interacts with agents in a customer service system via text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies.

**End User:** Calls the customer service line. Speaks to the voice agent. Example: `Hello, I need assistance with my billing inquiry`.<br>
**Voice Agent:** Transcribes user's speech into text using speech-to-text technology. Example: `Hello, I need assistance with my billing inquiry`.<br>
**Voice Agent:** Determines the need for human assistance. Initiates handover to the human agent via handover provider.<br>
**Human Agent:** Receives a conversation script containing user's query.<br>
**Human Agent:** Types response on interface. Example: `Hello, thank you for reaching out. Let me check your billing details`.<br>
**Voice Agent:** Receives human agent's typed response. Converts the text message into speech using text-to-speech technology.<br>
**End User:** Hears human agent's response spoken by voice agent. Example: `Hello, thank you for reaching out. Let me check your billing details`.<br>
**End User / Human Agent:** The conversation between the end user and the human agent continues until the issue is resolved or the interaction is concluded.

### Multilingual Support

Within the Handover Settings, you can use translation into other languages.
Use the translation feature in the Handover Settings to overcome language barriers between end users and support staff. This feature is particularly useful in situations where there are no support staff proficient in the end user's language, and urgent issue resolution is necessary.

For example, if a user communicates in German, the voice agent responds accordingly. 
However, after transferring the call to the contact center, the dialogue is translated into English.
The human agent responds in English, and the response is translated into German for the end user via text-to-speech technology.
This method ensures seamless communication despite language differences.

Note that depending on the language and provider selected, 
translations may experience delays while they reach the contact center. 
If the speech-to-text fails to recognize speech for any reason, the message won't appear on the contact center's side. 
Plan for such scenarios within your Flow and configure the voice agent's behavior accordingly. 
This approach will ensure that the end user is aware that their message may not be delivered.
You can achieve this by adjusting timeout settings and error handling policies.

#### Configuration

To set up a multilingual Flow for the handover use case, follow these steps:

1. In your voice Flow, navigate to the [Set Session Config](../../build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/parameter-details.md) Node.
2. In the Node editor, go to the **Recognizer STT** section and activate the **Recognize Language** toggle.
3. From the **Alternative Language** list, select the additional languages, for example, `German` and `Italian`.
4. Click **Save Node**. 
5. Below the Set Session Config Node, add a [Lookup](../../build/node-reference/logic/lookup.md) Node. 
6. In the parent Lookup Node, select **CognigyScript** from the **Type** list and specify `input.data.payload.speech.language_code` in the **Operator** field. 
7. Click **Save Node**. 
8. In the case Nodes of the Lookup Node, specify the language codes, for example, `de-DE`, `it-IT`. 
9. Click **Save Node**. 
10. Below each case Node, add the second [Set Session Config](../../build/node-reference/voice/voice-gateway/parameter-details.md) Nodes.
11. Configure the TTS and STT settings for each of the Set Session Config Nodes. This means that one Node should have German language selected, while the other should have Italian. These Nodes will manage the voice agent's communication in the end user's language. 
12. Below each Set Session Config Node, add the [Set Translation](../../build/node-reference/other-nodes/set-translation.md) Nodes. These Nodes will perform translation of a text from the end user's language to the human agent's language. 
13. In the Set Translation Node, activate the **Translation Enabled** toggle. 
14. In the **User Input Language** field, specify the language of the user input, for example, `de`, `it`. 
15. In the **Flow Language** field, specify the language to translate to, for example, `en`. 
16. Save your changes. 
17. At the end of the Flow, place the [Handover to Agent](../../build/node-reference/service/handover-to-agent.md) Node.

#### Example

In this example, an end user seeks billing assistance and interacts with actors in a customer service system via text-to-speech and speech-to-text technologies. The end user and human agent speak different languages, but this doesn't hinder their understanding, as the voice agent translates their speech into the required language for each party.

**End User:** Calls the customer service line. Speaks to the voice agent. Example: `Hallo, ich brauche Hilfe bei meiner Rechnungsanfrage`.<br>
**Voice Agent:** Determines the language and answers using the same language. Example: `Danke für die Informationen. Ich werde Sie an einen menschlichen Agenten weiterleiten, der Ihnen weiterhelfen kann`.<br>
**Voice Agent:** Transcribes user's speech into text using speech-to-text technology. Example: `Hello, I need assistance with my billing inquiry`.<br>
**Voice Agent:** Determines the need for human assistance and initiates the handover to the human agent via the handover provider.<br>
**Human Agent:** Receives a conversation script containing user's query.<br>
**Human Agent:** Types response on interface. Example: `I've found the issue. It seems there was an error in the billing statement. I'll correct it for you`.<br>
**Voice Agent:** Receives human agent's typed response. Converts the text message into speech using text-to-speech technology.<br>
**End User:** Hears human agent's response spoken by voice agent. Example: `Ich habe das Problem gefunden. Es scheint, dass es einen Fehler in der Rechnungsstellung gab. Ich werde es für dich korrigieren`.<br>
**End User/Human Agent:** The conversation between the end user and the human agent continues until the issue is resolved or the interaction is concluded.
