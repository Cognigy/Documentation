# Intent Trainer

One of the characteristics of AI Agents is that they can improve over time. Cognigy.AI provides the ability to tweak Agents based on existing dialogs. This can be done using the **Intent Trainer**.

The **Intent Trainer** enables you to analyze the collected user inputs (records)
and add them to [Intents](../../ai/empower/nlu/intents/ml-intents.md)
to improve your AI Agent's user input comprehension.
You can decide which user input record improves the Agents intent and then click **Add to Intent**.
Then use the **Train** button in the top right above the record list
to overtake the new intent to the **NLU intent list** in your Flow.
You do not need to execute "Build Model", because the "Train" functionality of the 'Intent Trainer'
did already the scoring - you will see that by the indicated scoring data and the color icons in the Intent list.

## Add to Intent
Adding a record to an Intent requires you to select the Flow and the target Intent, you can also modify it before adding. The input will become an Intent example sentence afterwards.

## Skip
**Skip** moves the user input to the **Skipped** records, however, once a user enters the same input again, it will also show up again in the **Unhandled** records of the Intent Trainer.

## Ignore
**Ignore** moves the user input to the **Ignored** records and once a user enters the same input again it will also be ignored.
