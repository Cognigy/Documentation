# Interaction Panel

The _Interaction Panel_ offers a robust interface for testing chat and voice AI Agents. You can run different tests and analyze how AI Agents respond. This approach allows you to evaluate the AI Agents' performance and change their communication and service skills.

The Interaction Panel provides the following features:

- **Three Testing Modes**. Test your AI Agent across all Channels with the [chat](chat.md), [voice call](voice-call.md), and [live follow](live-follow.md) modes to simulate real-world interactions.
- **Memory Inspection and Extraction**. View and extract the data stored in the [AI Agent's memory](../../build/ai-agent-memory/overview.md) to analyze its behavior and [State](state.md), as well as to identify potential areas for improvement.
- **Playbooks**. Use [Playbooks](../playbooks.md) to save time by automating repetitive tasks and catching errors efficiently.
- **Flexible Configuration**. Design custom test scenarios for in-depth analysis of your AI Agent's behavior.

## Prerequisites

- You must have a [Flow](../../build/flows/overview.md) with configured [Nodes](../../build/nodes/overview.md) to test the AI Agent.

## Explore the Interaction Panel

To open the Interaction Panel, click ![interaction-panel](../../../_assets/icons/interaction-panel.svg) in the upper-right corner. You can open the Interaction Panel from any page within your Project and set the Flow, [Locale](../../build/translation-and-localization/localization.md), and [Snapshot](../../deploy/snapshots.md) you want to test. However, when opened from the Flow Editor, the Interaction Panel uses the current Flow configuration and allows you to follow the Flow execution in real time.
