# Input

[![Version badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Updated in-v4.90-blue.svg)](../../../release-notes/4.90.md)

The Input is a short term JSON data object that is generated each time a message is sent to Cognigy.AI. 

The input object contains general information about the message such as the **Time** the message was received and the **Channel**
from where the message was sent.
More specific results from the NLU intent mapping process are also available, such as the **Intent** that was selected,
the **Slots** that were identified and many other useful pieces of information.

The input object is passed to the Project's [Flow](../../../ai/build/flows/overview.md) to decide on the next action to take. For more information about the lifespan of the input, see the [CognigyScript](../../../ai/build/cognigyscript.md) page.

!!! note "Intent Default Replies override flow logic"
    If an intent is configured with a default reply, this will override the AI Agent's flow logic and automatically be delivered as the response.

This is what Cognigy.AI uses to identify each user as a reference to their individual contact profile.<br>See Contact Profiles for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

### NLU Properties

The detailed NLU results are published to the **nlu** variable which contains the following properties:

| Key                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                        |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| detailedSlots       | Contains the detected slots ranging from automatic to custom lexicon libraries.                                                                                                    |
| intentId            | A unique id assigned to the intent that was selected by the NLU.                                                                                                                   |
| intentFlow          | A unique id assigned to the flow containing the selected intent.                                                                                                                   |
| intentMapperResults | Provides specific details about the NLU intent mapping results that includes a summary of the intent scoring for each of the trained intents located in the scores child property. |
| tokens              | Provides an array containing each word of the input sentence as a string element.                                                                                                  |

!!! note "NLU Properties are available after NLU only"
    The below properties below are computed by the NLU Connector.

    Consequently they are published **after** the NLU.

    **They are thus not available inside Cognigy NLU Rules and Conditions.**

    Properties written by the NLU into the Input:
    
      * intent
      * intentScore
      * nlu
      * type
      * intentLevel
      * localeId
      * understood
      * conditionalEntrypointWasExecuted

## Accessing the Input Object

Flow nodes can dynamically access Input properties via [Tokens](../../../ai/build/tokens.md) or [CognigyScript](../../../ai/build/cognigyscript.md) i.e. `{{ "{{input.property}}" }}`. The Cognigy Script used to access the input object follows the dot-notation `property.child.child`.

**Example**: `{{ "{{input.text}}" }}` would return the text message that was sent to the Flow.

!!! note "Copy JSON Path from the Input Object"
    You can copy the exact JSON path you need to reference a certain value in the Input object by right-clicking it and selecting "Copy JSON Path" from the context menu.
