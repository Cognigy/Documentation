# Chunk Editor

The _Chunk editor_ is an interface for managing [Knowledge Chunks](knowledge-chunk.md) and editing their content.

You can add, edit, rearrange, disable, and delete Knowledge Chunks, as well as add metadata to them. This way, you can ensure the accuracy and relevance of the knowledge you provide to your AI Agents. You can't save empty Knowledge Chunks.

To access the Chunk editor, select a Knowledge Store in **Build > Knowledge**, then a [Knowledge Source](../knowledge-source/knowledge-source.md).

## Explore the Knowledge Editor

The Chunk editor includes the Knowledge Chunks in the Knowledge Source as numbered text fields. Clicking the Knowledge Chunks expands the Knowledge Chunk and displays two areas where you can edit [Knowledge Chunk texts](knowledge-chunk.md#knowledge-chunk-text) and [Chunk metadata](knowledge-chunk.md#chunk-metadata).
