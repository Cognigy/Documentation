# Flows

[![Version badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Updated in-v4.80-blue.svg)](../../../release-notes/4.80.md)

A _Flow_ is a conversational structure consisting of [Nodes](../nodes/overview.md) that defines how AI Agents interact with users. With Flows, you can customize the behavior of AI Agents and design tailored and dynamic conversational experiences. AI Agents can access the [Input](../../test/interaction-panel/input.md), [Context](../../test/interaction-panel/context.md), and [Profile](../../test/interaction-panel/profile.md) objects from the Flow to provide context-aware responses.

Flows include:

- [Nodes](../nodes/overview.md) — the Flow's building blocks.
- [Intents](../../empower/nlu/intents/ml-intents.md) — user input mapping with natural language understanding (NLU).
- [Lexicons](../../empower/nlu/slots-and-lexicons/lexicons.md) — keyphrases to improve Intent recognition.
- [Locales](../translation-and-localization/localization.md) — language settings for a multilingual AI Agent.
- [States](../../test/interaction-panel/state.md) — control over Intents.
- [Slot Fillers](../../empower/nlu/slot-fillers.md) — automatic information extraction from user input.

You can also connect different [Flows](../../empower/nlu/attachments/attached-flows.md) and switch between them with a [Go To Node](../node-reference/logic/go-to.md) to create more complex conversational experiences.

## Working with Flows

=== "GUI"
    You can create, clone, and delete Flows in **Build > Flows**. Also, you can export Flows as a Package, copy their Reference ID. To build and configure Flows, use the [Flow editor](editor.md).

    You can create Flows using [Generative AI](../../empower/generative-ai.md#generate-flows) to automatically generate Nodes with predefined configurations and content. For this approach, you need to add a [large language model](../../empower/generative-ai.md#prerequisites) (LLM).

    To test Flows, click ![interaction-panel-icon](../../../_assets/icons/interaction-panel.svg) and use the [Interaction Panel](../../test/interaction-panel/overview.md).

=== "API"
    You can view, create, and edit Flows using the [Cognigy API](https://api-dev.cognigy.ai/openapi#tag--Charts-v2.0).

=== "CLI"
    You can manage Flows using the [Cognigy CLI](https://github.com/Cognigy/Cognigy-CLI).

### Settings

Besides the Nodes, you can customize Flows further on the **Settings** tab of the [Flow editor](editor.md). For example, you can add Yes/No logic and personalized confirmation responses. Also, you can fine-tune the AI Agent's confidence in understanding Intents and activate recognition of specific details, including age, date, and email addresses, to ensure more accurate responses.

The level of confidence accepts values ranging from 0 to 1.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
    | Reconfirmation Threshold                                              | Determine a score from which an Intent is considered confirmed or marked for reconfirmation if a reconfirmation sentence is set. By default, the value is `0.2`. Note that the confidence threshold has **no effect unless the Intent uses confirmation sentences**. The Reconfirmation Threshold is the lower confidence threshold. You must set it in addition to the Confidence Threshold. Intent scores above the reconfirmation threshold are confirmed or marked for reconfirmation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
