# Analytics Data

[![Version badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Updated in-v4.90-blue.svg)](../../../../../release-notes/4.90.md)

In a [Code Node](overview.md), you can modify certain parts of the analytics data to get more control of what exactly is written to analytics.

You can access the analytics data in a Code Node by using the key `analyticsdata`. For example:

```javascript
analyticsdata.intent = "test";
```

## Custom Fields

Custom fields let you add extra data to your Analytics reports. 
This feature helps you analyze your data more deeply and get insights beyond the standard metrics. By customizing your data, you can make better decisions that fit your specific business needs and goals.

### Limitations

- The maximum length of a custom field is 1024 characters.

??? info "Store Complex Custom Data"

    For more complex data, you can use a string field object. 

    In this example, `custom1` stores a simple string value, while `custom2` uses a JSON representation of the `customData` object to store more complex information.

    ```javascript
    const customData = {
      key: "value"
    };

    analyticsdata.custom1 = "userFocusGroup: focusGroup1";
    analyticsdata.custom2 = JSON.stringify(customData);
    ```

## Analytics Data Lifespan

The analyticsdata object is generated for each Flow Execution.
This means that any data you store in the analyticsdata object
(for example, a custom field) will only be stored in analytics for this Flow Execution.
On the next Flow Execution, there will be a new analyticsdata object with a new Intent.
