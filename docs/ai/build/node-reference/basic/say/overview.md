## Description

A Say Node is used to send a message to the user.

Depending on the current Channel, additional rich media formats are available. Add a new channel output by clicking the **+** icon and selecting the channel that corresponds to the channel endpoint that will be deployed.

## Settings

### Channels

list all channels


### Output Type 

The AI Channel allows for the configuration of different **Output Types**. Not all [endpoints](../../../deploy/endpoints/overview.md) can correctly convert your content to the desired output type. Before configuration, [check the compatibility](../../../deploy/endpoints/content-conversion.md) of the output type with the endpoint.

#### Text

The **Text** Output Type renders text and emojis (if supported by the channel). The text field also supports [CognigyScript](../../cognigy-script.md) and [Tokens](../../tokens.md) that can be added by clicking the **AI** button at the end of each field.

Multiple text messages can be added for conversational variation.
When multiple text messages are configured,
the delivery order is controlled by the *linear* and *loop* settings available in the ***options*** dropdown menu.

By configuring multiple messages in a text say node, only one message will be delivered per activation of the node.
An additional say node must be configured in order to send two text messages at once.

Keep in mind that **emojis** may not render properly on all channels.

| Parameters | Type          | Description                                          |
|------------|---------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Text       | CognigyScript | Enter the text. Does not support markdown, only html |

##### Options

When you send text responses, you can control how the text is delivered and attach additional data to the message. The following options are available for configuring the behavior:

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------|--------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Linear    | Toggle | Controls whether the text responses are shown in a specific order (linearly) or randomly. If enabled, the text options are presented one after the other in the defined sequence.                                                                                     |
| Loop      | Toggle | Works in conjunction with the **Linear** option. If **Linear** is enabled and **Loop** is also enabled, the sequence starts over from the beginning after reaching the end. If **Loop** is disabled, the last text option will keep repeating after reaching the end. |
| Data      | JSON   | Allows you to include additional data that you want to send along with the message to the client. For example, `{ "type": "motivational" }`.                                                                                                                          |

When configuring the Linear and Loop parameters, you can achieve different message delivery behavior:

| Scenario             | Configuration            | Example Conversation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

#### Text with Quick Replies

!!! warning "Channel Support"
    The **Text with Quick Replies** Output Type is currently converted to compatible output on all the following channels: **Webchat**, **Messenger**, **Line**, **Azure Bot Service**, **Sunshine Conversations**, **Slack** and **RingCentral Engage**.


Text with Quick Replies can be used to show the user a number of configurable Quick Replies. Quick Replies are pre-defined answers that are rendered as input chips.

#### Gallery

Galleries are powerful visual widgets that are ideal for showing a list of options with images. They are typically used to show a number of products or other items that can be browsed.

A gallery can be configured with a number of cards. A card contains an image, a title and a subtitle and can be configured with (optional) buttons.

!!! warning "Channel Support"
    The **Gallery** Output Type is currently converted to compatible output on all the following channels: **Webchat**, **Messenger**, **Line**, **Azure Bot Service**, **Sunshine Conversations**, **Slack** and **RingCentral Engage**.

| Condition: Cognigy Script | CognigyScript | Allows to control when cards are shown or hidden based on conditions written in CognigyScript. If you're displaying cards in a Gallery and only want to show a card when there's data, use this condition: `{{ "{{context.array.length > 0}}" }}`. It checks if the array has items (length is greater than 0). If true, the card will appear; if false, it stays hidden.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| Select Button Type        | Dropdown      | - Postback Value - when a **Postback Value** is configured and the **Quick Reply** is clicked, the Postback Value will be sent to the start of the Flow. This simulates user input - it is "as if" the user would have manually typed something. This is the most typical behavior for Quick Replies.<br>- Phone Number - when this option is configured, clicking the Quick Reply will try to open the phone application on the device.<br>- Trigger Intent - the Trigger Intent feature allows you to manually trigger an Intent by writing cIntent:, followed by the desired intent name in your text input, the regular Intent mapping will be ignored.

| Condition: Cognigy Script | CognigyScript | Allows to control when buttons are shown or hidden based on conditions written in CognigyScript. If you're displaying buttons in a card and only want to show a  when there's data, use this condition: `{{ "{{context.array.length > 0}}" }}`. It checks if the array has items (length is greater than 0). If true, the button will appear; if false, it stays hidden.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Select Button Type        | Dropdown      | - Postback Value - when a **Postback Value** is configured and the **Quick Reply** is clicked, the Postback Value will be sent to the start of the Flow. This simulates user input - it is "as if" the user would have manually typed something. This is the most typical behavior for Quick Replies.<br>- Phone Number - when this option is configured, clicking the Quick Reply will try to open the phone application on the device.<br>- Trigger Intent - the Trigger Intent feature allows you to manually trigger an Intent by writing cIntent:, followed by the desired intent name in your text input, the regular Intent mapping will be ignored.

| Condition: Cognigy Script | CognigyScript | Allows to control when buttons are shown or hidden based on conditions written in CognigyScript. If you're displaying buttons in a card and only want to show a  when there's data, use this condition: `{{ "{{context.array.length > 0}}" }}`. It checks if the array has items (length is greater than 0). If true, the button will appear; if false, it stays hidden.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Condition: Cognigy Script | CognigyScript | Allows to control when buttons are shown or hidden based on conditions written in CognigyScript. If you're displaying buttons in a card and only want to show a  when there's data, use this condition: `{{ "{{context.array.length > 0}}" }}`. It checks if the array has items (length is greater than 0). If true, the button will appear; if false, it stays hidden.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| Select Button Type        | Dropdown      | - Postback Value - when a **Postback Value** is configured and the **Quick Reply** is clicked, the Postback Value will be sent to the start of the Flow. This simulates user input - it is "as if" the user would have manually typed something. This is the most typical behavior for Quick Replies.<br>- Phone Number - when this option is configured, clicking the Quick Reply will try to open the phone application on the device.<br>- Trigger Intent - the Trigger Intent feature allows you to manually trigger an Intent by writing cIntent:, followed by the desired intent name in your text input, the regular Intent mapping will be ignored.

#### Adaptive Card

[![Version badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Updated in-v4.56-blue.svg)](../../../../../release-notes/4.56.md)

The Adaptive Card Type allows you to configure an adaptive card output. Adaptive Cards offer customization options, support for rich media (images, video, and audio), ease of use with a simple JSON schema, and the ability to create dynamic content for users to match their specific needs and branding.

To create an adaptive card, use the [Adaptive Card Designer](https://adaptivecards.io/designer). Customize the existing JSON, then copy and paste it into the code editor. If JSON is correct, you will see the adaptive card rendered under the code editor.

!!! warning
    Cognigy supports the limited number of versions for Adaptive Card, so using the latest versions may cause issues. We recommend using [supported versions](../../../deploy/endpoints/content-conversion.md) for better compatibility.

### AI-enhanced output

To use AI-enhanced output rephrasing, read the [Generative AI](../../../empower/generative-ai.md) article.

### Handover Settings

When using a handover, such as to a live agent, you can choose who receives the message from the AI Agent:

- **User and Agent** — by default, both the end user and the human agent will receive the message.
- **User only** — the end user will receive the message.
- **Agent only** — the responsible human agent will receive the message.
