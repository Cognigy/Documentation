## Description

The Match Pattern Node enables a user to find patterns in text and expose them in the [Input object](../../../test/interaction-panel/input.md).

You can define patterns to search for in the input text or in the alternate text that was provided. If a pattern is found, a `matchedPatterns` group is created in the Input object.

## Patterns

Patterns can be any text and can contain references to Slots by using the `@` symbol. 

Example: `@color @product`

In `I need a green shirt`, two Slots are found and assigned to `color = green` and `product = shirt`.

### Tags

You can tag Slots in a pattern to make it easier to identify them later.

Example: `from @city>origin to @city>destination`.

In `I want to go from DÃ¼sseldorf to Tokyo`, the `city` Slot is found in a matched pattern group with origin and destination tags.

| Create New Slots        | Boolean     | Indicate whether new Slots are created from tags or not.                      |
| Tag Existing Slots      | Boolean     | Indicate whether existing Slots are tagged or not.                            |

| Alternate Input         | CognigyText | The input text to use instead of the current input text.                      |

## Example

Text: `I want to fly from bErlin to NEW York with 3 or 4 people on October 1st 2021 if its 30 degrees and I am 22 years old 100%`

Pattern: `from @city>origin to @city>destination with @NUMBER>ppl1 or @NUMBER>ppl2 people @DATE>date if its @TEMPERATURE>celsius degrees and I am @AGE>userage years old @PERCENTAGE>perc`

Result:
