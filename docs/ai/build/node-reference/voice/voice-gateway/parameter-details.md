# Voice Gateway Parameter Details

Cognigy Voice Gateway has many configuration settings that are controlled directly from within your Flow. These settings can be applied individually to the scopes:

- **Setting Session Parameters**. Session parameters can comfortably be set with the [Set Session Config](set-session-config.md) Node. When executed, the settings will apply for the remainder of the session.
- **Setting Activity Parameters**. Activity parameters can be set per activity/node. If, for example, barge-in is set on the [Play](play.md) Node, barge-in will only be activated during the execution of this Node. Therefore, the user can interrupt the AI Agent during this output but not afterward. These configurations are also available in the [Say](../../basic/say.md), [Question](../../basic/question.md), and [Optional Question](../../basic/optional-question.md) Nodes.

| Disable TTS Audio Caching  | Toggle        | Disables TTS audio caching.<br><br> By default, the setting is deactivated. In this case, previously requested TTS audio results are stored in the AI Agent cache. When a new TTS request is made, and the audio text has been previously requested, the AI Agent retrieves the cached result instead of sending another request to the TTS provider.<br><br> When the setting is activated, the AI Agent no longer caches TTS results. In this case, each request is directly sent to your speech provider.  <br><br> Note that disabling caching can increase TTS costs. For detailed information, contact your speech provider. |

For detailed information about Deepgram models, refer to the [Deepgram documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/model).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Endpointing                     | Toggle        | This parameter is active only when Deepgram is selected in the STT Vendor setting. <br><br> Deepgram's Endpointing feature watches streaming audio for long pauses that signal the end of speech. When it spots an endpoint, it finalizes predictions and returns the transcript, marking it as complete with the `speech_final` parameter set to `true`.  For detailed information about Deepgram Endpointing, refer to the [Deepgram documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/endpointing).<br><br>The duration for detecting the end of speech is preconfigured with a default value (10 milliseconds). If you want to change this value, use the Endpointing Time setting. |
| Endpointing Time                | Number        | This parameter is active only when Deepgram is selected in the STT Vendor setting and the Endpointing toggle is enabled. <br><br> Customize the duration (in milliseconds) for detecting the end of speech. The default is 10 milliseconds of silence. Transcripts are sent after detecting silence, and the system waits until the speaker resumes or the required silence time is reached. Once either condition is met, a transcript is sent back with `speech_final` set to `true`.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Smart Formatting                | Toggle        | This parameter is active only when Deepgram is selected in the STT Vendor setting. <br><br> Deepgram's Smart Format feature applies additional formatting to transcripts to optimize them for human readability. Smart Format capabilities vary between models. When Smart Formatting is turned on, Deepgram will always apply the best-available formatting for your chosen model, tier, and language combination. For detailed examples, refer to the [Deepgram documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/smart-format). <br><br> Note that when Smart Formatting is turned on, punctuation will be activated, even if you have the Disable STT Punctuation setting enabled.  |
| STT Hints                       | Text          | Array of words or phrases to assist speech detection. If you want to use multiple hints, enter each hint into a separate input field. For instance, you can enter `Germany` in the first field, `France` in the second field, and `Netherlands` in the third field. The STT provider will receive the data in array format: ["Germany", "France", "Netherlands"]. <br> Note: This requires support from the STT engine. The field is not available for the Nuance speech vendor.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Dynamic Hints                   | CognigyScript | Uses context or input for adding array hints. For example, <code>&lcub;&lcub;context.hints&rcub;&rcub;</code> or <code>&lcub;&lcub;input.hints&rcub;&rcub;</code>. You can override these settings using [Advanced parameters](#advanced).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| STT Label                       | CognigyScript | The alternative name of the vendor is the one you [specify in the Voice Gateway Self-Service Portal](../../../../../voice-gateway/webapp/applications.md#add-additional-tts-and-stt-vendor). If you have created multiple speech services from the same vendor, use the label to specify which service to use.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Google Model                    | Dropdown      | This parameter is active only when Google is selected in the STT Vendor setting.<br><br>Utilizes one of Google Cloud Speech-to-Text transcription models, with the `latest_short` model being the default choice. For a detailed list of Google models, refer to the [Transcription models](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/transcription-model#transcription_models)  section in the Google Documentation. Keep in mind that the `default` value is a Google Model type that can be used if other models don't suit your specific scenario.                                                                                                                                 |

### Barge In

[![Version badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Updated in-v4.80-blue.svg)](../../../../../release-notes/4.80.md)

!!! Warning
    Enabled Barge-In uses the [TTS and SST vendor](../../../../../voice-gateway/references/tts-and-stt-vendors.md) to listen throughout the entire conversation. Consequently, Barge-In may lead to increased subscription costs with your vendor.

Barge In is a feature that allows the caller to interrupt the voice AI Agent by using speech input or DTMF digits during the entire call. By default, this feature is turned off.

Before release 4.80, this feature could not be controlled when the call was transferred to the contact center. Barge In was always active, allowing the caller to interrupt the voice AI Agent at any time.

Starting with release 4.80, you can enable or disable Barge In when the call is redirected to the contact center. This improvement lets you decide whether the caller should listen to the voice AI Agent's messages fully or have the option to interrupt them.
This way, the caller can't use Barge In to skip, for example, important legal information such as the GDPR.

To ensure Barge In works correctly after the call is transferred to the contact center, place the Set Session Config Node above the Handover to Agent Node.

### User Input Timeout

[![Version badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Updated in-v4.81-blue.svg)](../../../../../release-notes/4.81.md)

This feature defines what should happen when there is no input from the user.

Before the release [4.81](../../../../../release-notes/4.81.md), User Input Timeout was always enabled and users had to determine the number of milliseconds before timeout occurred. Starting from release [4.81](../../../../../release-notes/4.81.md), users can enable or disable User Input Timeout using a toggle. This setting keeps the voice AI Agent on the call even if the caller takes a while to respond. When the User Input Timeout is disabled, the voice AI Agent will wait for the caller's response.

### Flow No Input Timeout

[![Version badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Added in-v4.87-blue.svg)](../../../../../release-notes/4.87.md)

This feature is designed for use cases where response delays occur in a flow, such as when utilizing large language models (LLMs), waiting for responses from external services, or managing complex processing tasks. It helps maintain user engagement by proactively delivering information or prompts during these delays.

For example, you can inform end users that their request is being processed or that assistance is on the way.

### Atmosphere Sounds

[![Version badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Added in-v4.79-blue.svg)](../../../../../release-notes/4.79.md)

This feature is useful in scenarios where users interact with an AI Agent instead of a human when calling the contact center. Within the Atmosphere Sound section, you can configure the MP3 background track. This track may include office noises or other sounds that simulate human interaction, helping the caller feel they are speaking with a person rather than an AI Agent.
Playing a background MP3 track during the conversation with AI Agents makes it more engaging and personalized.

The track plays during the conversation with the AI Agent, continues when the call is transferred to a human agent, and stops once the human agent accepts the call.

| Parameter | Type     | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-----------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Action    | Dropdown | Selects an action to play, silence, or remove the track: <br> - **play** - plays the track in the background. <br> - **silence** - mutes the track. <br> - **remove** - removes the track from the background completely.                                                                                 |
| URL       | Text     | Accepts direct URL links to MP3 tracks, for example, `https://abc.xyz/music.mp3`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| Volume    | Number   | Adjusts the volume of the track. Can be set from -50 to +50 dB. The default value is 0, meaning that the track is played as-is, with no adjustments to its volume. Users may need to adjust the volume by testing the call and checking if the Atmosphere Sounds track is neither too loud nor too quiet. |

### Silence Overlay

Silence Overlay enables you to play an MP3 file in the background during calls with an AI Agent. This feature is activated during prolonged periods of silence, which may result from the AI Agent's background activity. Playing the track informs the customer that the AI Agent is processing their query, which may take some time. The Silence Overlay track can simulate office sounds, for example, a human agent typing on a keyboard and clicking the mouse.

When Silence Overlay is enabled in the [Set Session Config](./set-session-config.md) Node, the Silence Overlay track starts playing automatically once the AI Agent takes longer to respond, then stops the moment the AI Agent responds. You can adjust the delay before the Silence Overlay starts to make it sound more natural.

If you enabled the [Call Recording](../../../../../voice-gateway/webapp/recent-calls.md#call-recordings) feature in the Voice Gateway Self-Service Portal, the Silence Overlay track is recorded together with the AI Agent's track and can be played back in the audio file.

This parameter appears when the play action is selected.                                                                                                                                                                        |
