| Disable TTS Audio Caching  | Toggle        | Disables TTS audio caching.<br><br> By default, the setting is deactivated. In this case, previously requested TTS audio results are stored in the AI Agent cache. When a new TTS request is made and the audio text has been previously requested, the AI Agent retrieves the cached result instead of sending another request to the TTS provider.<br><br> When the setting is activated, the AI Agent caches TTS results but doesn't use them. In this case, each request is directly sent to your speech provider.  <br><br> Note that disabling caching can increase TTS costs. For detailed information, contact your speech provider. |

For instance, you can enter `Germany` in the first field, `France` in the second field, and `Netherlands` in the third field. The STT provider will receive the data in array format: ["Germany", "France", "Netherlands"]. <br> Note: This requires support from the STT engine.

For example, <code>&lcub;&lcub;context.hints&rcub;&rcub;</code> or <code>&lcub;&lcub;input.hints&rcub;&rcub;</code>.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Google Model                    | Dropdown      | This parameter is active only when Google is selected in the STT Vendor setting.<br><br>Utilizes one of Google Cloud Speech-to-Text transcription models, with the `latest_short` model being the default choice. For a detailed list of Google models, refer to the [Transcription models](https://cloud.google.com/speech-to-text/docs/transcription-model#transcription_models)  section in the Google Documentation. Keep in mind that the `default` value is a Google Model type that can be used if other models don't suit your specific scenario.                                                                                                                                 |
| Enable Voice Activity Detection | Toggle        | Delays connection to cloud recognizer until the speech is detected.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Disable STT Punctuation         | Toggle        | This parameter is active only when Google or Deepgram is selected in the STT Vendor setting.<br><br> Prevents the STT response from the AI Agent to include punctuation marks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Deepgram Model                  | Dropdown      | This parameter is active only when Deepgram is selected in the STT Vendor setting. <br><br> Choose a model for processing submitted audio. Each model is associated with a tier. Ensure that the selected tier is available for the chosen STT language.  For detailed information about Deepgram models, refer to the [Deepgram documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/model).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Endpointing                     | Toggle        | This parameter is active only when Deepgram is selected in the STT Vendor setting. <br><br> Deepgram's Endpointing feature watches streaming audio for long pauses that signal the end of speech. When it spots an endpoint, it finalizes predictions and returns the transcript, marking it as complete with the `speech_final` parameter set to `true`.  For detailed information about Deepgram Endpointing, refer to the [Deepgram documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/endpointing).<br><br>The duration for detecting the end of speech is preconfigured with a default value (10 milliseconds). If you want to change this value, use the Endpointing Time setting. |
| Endpointing Time                | Number        | This parameter is active only when Deepgram is selected in the STT Vendor setting and the Endpointing toggle is enabled. <br><br> Customize the duration (in milliseconds) for detecting the end of speech. The default is 10 milliseconds of silence. Transcripts are sent after detecting silence, and the system waits until the speaker resumes or the required silence time is reached. Once either condition is met, a transcript is sent back with `speech_final` set to `true`.                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Smart Formatting                | Toggle        | This parameter is active only when Deepgram is selected in the STT Vendor setting. <br><br> Deepgram's Smart Format feature applies additional formatting to transcripts to optimize them for human readability. Smart Format capabilities vary between models. When Smart Formatting is turned on, Deepgram will always apply the best-available formatting for your chosen model, tier, and language combination. For detailed examples, refer to the [Deepgram documentation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/smart-format).                                                                                                                                                      |
