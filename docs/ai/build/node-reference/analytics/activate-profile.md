## Description

This Node is used to reactivate a [specific Contact Profile](../../../analyze/contact-profiles.md#view-a-contact-profile) that has been deactivated, in case the user disabled data collection by mistake or wants to allow data collection again.

## Use Case

Consider placing this Node below an [If](../logic/if.md) Node to trigger it when the contact allows collecting their data.
