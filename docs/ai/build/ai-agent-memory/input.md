# Input

[![Version badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Updated in-v2025.19-blue.svg)](../../../release-notes/2025.19.md)

The _Input Object_ is a JSON object that serves as the short-term AI Agent memory. The Input object is generated each time the user sends a message or provides a voice input to an AI Agent.

The Input object stores:

- General data about the user input, such as time and type of input
- Endpoint-specific data
- Results from the NLU Intent mapping process, such as the recognized [Intent](../../empower/nlu/intents/overview.md) and [Slots](../../empower/nlu/slots/overview.md)

## Limitations

- You can store up to 1.5 MB in the Input object. For dedicated SaaS and on-premises installations, you can configure the limit using the `MAX_MEMORY_OBJECT_SIZE` variable in the `values.yaml` file. Increasing the object size could lead to performance issues.

## Properties

!!! note
    The data in the Input object depends on the Endpoint through which the user input is received. This article doesn't include all possible property variations.

## Working with the Input Object

You can view the Input object by navigating to **Info > Input** in the [Interaction Panel](../../../ai/test/interaction-panel/overview.md). You can copy the exact JSON path of an Input object value by right-clicking it and selecting **Copy JSON Path**.

### Accessing Input Properties

Nodes can dynamically access Input properties with [CognigyScript](../../../ai/build/cognigyscript.md), for example, `{{"{{input.property}}"}}` or [Tokens](../../../ai/build/tokens.md). The CognigyScript expression you use to access the input object follows the dot notation for JSON objects: `property.child.child`.

#### Examples

- `{{"{{input.text}}"}}` returns the text that the user sent to the Flow.
- `{{"{{input.nlu.tokens}}"}}` returns the tokens of the user input in an array.
- `{{"{{input.attachments[0].url}}"}}` returns the URL of the first attachment uploaded to the chat.
