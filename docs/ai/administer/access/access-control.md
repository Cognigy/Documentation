# Access Control

[![Version badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Updated in-v4.69-blue.svg)](../../../release-notes/4.69.md)

The _Access Control_ interface provides a user management tool for organizational-level administration.
It acts as an Access Control List (ACL), enabling the assignment of specific roles to users.

You can assign the following types of roles:

- [Global Roles](#global-roles). These roles apply to all Agents (projects) within your organization. Global roles set basic access rights for all Agents the user can access.
- [Project Roles](../access/members.md). These roles are specific to an Agent (project). You can assign project-level roles via the [Members Panel](../access/members.md) to extend user permissions for creating, editing, viewing, and updating entities within a specific Agent.

Before assigning roles, create a user in your organization.

## Global Roles

Global Roles are assigned to a user to establish basic access control. This list serves as the basis for defining user permissions across the entire organization.

The following global roles are available:

| Role                  | 	Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `admin`               | Admins have unlimited access to anything inside their organization. In a new installation, the system will create one user with this role.
