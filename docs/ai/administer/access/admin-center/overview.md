# Admin Center

[![Version badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Updated in-v4.89-blue.svg)](../../../../release-notes/4.89.md)

The *Admin Center* allows Cognigy.AI users with `admin`[^*] rights to manage the organization by monitoring metrics for key resources, controlling access, and tracking system events. 
It includes the following sections:

- [Dashboard](../../access/admin-center/dashboard.md)
- [Access Control](../../access/admin-center/access-control.md)
- [Audit Events](../../access/admin-center/audit-events.md) 

You can access the **Admin Center** interface using one of the following options:

- Click **User Menu ![user-menu](../../../../_assets/icons/user-menu.svg) > Admin Center** on the **Main** page.
- Select **Admin Center** from the User Menu in the bottom-left corner of the Project page.

[^*]: While users with `admin` rights have full control over the Admin Center, users with other roles can view or manage specific pages within the Admin Center.
