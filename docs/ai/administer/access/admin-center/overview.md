[![Version badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Updated in-v4.89-blue.svg)](../../../../release-notes/4.89.md)

The *Admin Center* is the central hub in Cognigy.AI that enables users with admin[^*] rights to manage the organization. With the Admin Center, you can monitor key resource metrics, control access, track system events, and manage global resources. 

The Admin Center interface includes the following sections:

- [Dashboard](../../access/admin-center/dashboard.md)
- [Access Control](../../access/admin-center/access-control.md)
- [Audit Events](../../access/admin-center/audit-events.md) 
- [Resources](../../access/admin-center/global-resources/overview.md)

Access the Admin Center using one of the following options:

- Click **User Menu > Admin Center** on the **Main** page.
- Select **Admin Center** from the User Menu in the bottom-left corner of the **Project** page.

[^*]: While users with admin rights have full control over the Admin Center, users with other roles can view or manage specific pages within the Admin Center.
