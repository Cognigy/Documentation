# Global Resources

[![Version badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Added in-v4.97-blue.svg)](../../../../../release-notes/4.97.md)

_Global Resources_ are Cognigy.AI resources that you can assign to and share across different Projects in your organization. Global resources work similarly to their counterparts at Project level and have a similar [user interface as other resources](../../../../overview/user-interface/resource-pages.md).

Global resources include:

- [Global Large Language Models](global-llms.md)
- [Global Connections](global-connections.md)

## Restrictions

- Only users with `admin` [global role](../access-control.md) can access global resources.
- You can't export global resources as a [Package](../../../../build/packages.md) or [Snapshot](../../../../deploy/snapshots.md).
