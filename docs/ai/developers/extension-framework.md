# Extension Framework

The _Extension Framework_ provides developers with the ability
to create custom Nodes that go beyond the pre-built and marketplace Nodes.

## Capabilities of Custom Nodes

Custom Nodes can offer new actions, integrate with external systems, process data,
and improve conversational scenarios for users.

## Development Requirements

Developing custom Nodes requires:

- Knowledge of TypeScript/JavaScript.
- Installation of Node.js and NPM packages.
