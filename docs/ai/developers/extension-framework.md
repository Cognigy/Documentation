# Extension Framework

The Extension Framework provides developers with the ability
to create custom Nodes that go beyond the pre-built and marketplace Nodes.

These custom Nodes can offer new actions, integrate with external systems, process data,
and improve conversational scenarios for users.
Developing custom Nodes requires TypeScript/JavaScript knowledge and the installation of Node.js and NPM packages.

To start implementing a custom Node, refer to the [Cognigy Help Center](https://support.cognigy.com/hc/en-us/articles/360016534459-Getting-Started-with-Extensions#h_01HTMF96TZ828THMJJXV8EQ445).
