# IP Ranges Shared Environments

This page contains the IP addresses used by our environments to perform SIP signaling or to send outbound requests.

If you implement IP whitelisting on your API servers to further secure your solution, inform Cognigy Support or your Customer Success Manager.

!!! note
    The list of IP addresses may change over time. Cognigy will promptly notify you of any updates.

!!! warning
    The IP addresses for SIP signaling aren't used for transmitting audio data. Separate IP addresses handle audio/media traffic and are subject to change due to automatic scaling, so Cognigy doesn't provide those addresses. The required IPs and ports for audio/media will be negotiated dynamically when establishing calls.
