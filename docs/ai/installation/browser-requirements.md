## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues with browser compatibility, ensure the following before contacting the Cognigy support team:

- You are using the latest version of one of the Cognigy.AI supported browsers.
- Your viewport is larger than 1280x800 pixels.
- For using Microsoft Japanese IME, your Edge or Chrome browser is on Windows 10 or higher, as there might be issues with other browsers and operating systems.
