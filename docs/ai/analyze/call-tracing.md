# Call Tracing

If you create a voice agent and use Voice Gateway as a voice provider, record your calls while setting up your voice agents for debugging purposes. 
This approach lets troubleshoot your calls, identify where latencies are coming from, and listen to your voice agents' outputs to ensure they are working seamlessly.

For more information, read the [Recent Calls](../../voice-gateway/webapp/recent-calls.md) article in the Voice Gateway documentation.
