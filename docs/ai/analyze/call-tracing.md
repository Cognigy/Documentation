# Call Tracing

If you create a voice AI Agent and use Voice Gateway as a voice provider, you can record calls while setting up your voice AI Agent for debugging purposes. This approach lets you troubleshoot voice AI Agents, identify what is causing latency, and listen to the voice AI Agents' outputs to ensure they work as expected.

For more information, read the [Recent Calls](../../voice-gateway/webapp/recent-calls.md) article in the Voice Gateway documentation.
