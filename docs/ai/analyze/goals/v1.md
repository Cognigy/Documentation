# Goals v1

_Goals v2_ let you monitor when specific events occur within your Flow. 

To track these specific events within a Flow, use a [Goal Completion](../../build/node-reference/analytics/complete-goal.md) Node.

Once the Node is triggered,
the goal is recorded in the Analytics database and can be monitored in the [Contact Profile](../contact-profiles.md),
viewed in Insights [dashboards](../../../insights/dashboards/overview.md) and [explorers](../../../insights/explorers/transcript.md#session-transcript-details), and accessed through the [OData Endpoint](../odata.md) for further analysis.

For more information, read the [Complete Goal Node](../../../ai/build/node-reference/analytics/complete-goal.md) article.
