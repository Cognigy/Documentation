# Goals v1

Goals v1 provides a Node that allows you to track specific events within a Flow. 
Once the Goal completion Node is triggered,
the Goal is recorded in the Analytics database and can be monitored in the [Contact Profile](../contact-profiles.md),
viewed in Insights [dashboards](../../../insights/dashboards/overview.md) and [explores](../../../insights/explorers/transcript.md#session-transcript-details), and accessed through the [OData Endpoint](../odata.md) for further analysis.
For more information, read the [Complete Goal](../../../ai/build/node-reference/analytics/complete-goal.md) article.
