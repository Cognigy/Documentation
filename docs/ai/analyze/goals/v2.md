# Goals v2

_Goals v2_ enhances the previous version, [Goals v1](v1.md), by tracking not only user actions during AI Agent conversations but also aligning them with business objectives.

With Goals, you can evaluate and enhance the business impact of your AI Agent:

- **Track user interactions**. Monitor specific user interactions during conversations to ensure they align with your business objectives.
- **Monitor different goals and their steps**. Track different goals and their corresponding steps to get a comprehensive view of the user journey within conversations.
- **Measure business value**. Goals are linked to business metrics, allowing you to assess the value of AI Agents in achieving key business objectives. Tracking metrics such as time and cost savings for each completed goal and step provides a detailed view of the AI Agent's performance.
- **Gain valuable insights**. Measure how effectively your AI Agent conversations achieve business objectives and optimize AI Agents to improve performance and user satisfaction.

## Prerequisites

- To activate this feature, use the `FEATURE_USE_GOALS_V2` feature flag.

## Limitations

- The default number of steps per goal is 10. You can increase this number to 20 by using the `FEATURE_USE_GOALS_V2__MAX_STEPS_PER_GOAL` variable in the `values.yaml` file.

## How to Use

### Determine What you Want to Measure

Decide whether you want to track money, time, or both:

- **Money Saved**. Track cost savings. To set the currency, go to **Manage > Settings > Currency Settings** and select a currency type from the **Set Standard Currency** list. You can select only one type of currency per Project.
- **Time Saved**. Measure the amount of time a person would have spent on the task. This metric shows the human time saved each time the goal is achieved.

### Create a Goal

To create a goal, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cognigy.AI Interface.
2. Go to the Project where you want to create a goal.
3. In the left-side menu of the Project, go to **Build > Goals** and click **+ New Goal**.
4. On the **Goal** page, configure the parameters of a goal:
    - **Name** — enter a name that reflects the goal. For example, `Reduce Call Handling Time` or `Increase Automation Efficiency`.
    - **Description** — provide a brief description that reflects the goal. For example, `This goal aims to reduce average call handling time by automating common customer requests`.
5. In the **Initial Step** section, complete the following fields:
    - **Name** — provide a descriptive name for the starting step. For example, `Initiate AI Agent Conversation`. The initial step is required, as the goal activates when the Flow triggers this step.
    - **Description** — add a detailed description of the starting step. For example, `This step triggers when a user begins an AI Agent session`.
6. In the **Steps** section, click **+ New Step** and add at least one step to complete the goal configuration. Note that if you add only one step, it must be marked as a Completion Point.
7. Configure the step parameters:
    - **Name** — enter a name that reflects the step. For example, `Customer Request Handled`.
    - **Description** — describe the step. For example, `This step captures when the AI Agent successfully resolves a customer request`.
    - **Mark this step as a completion step** — activate this setting to mark the current step as the point where the goal is considered fully completed. For example, this step can reflect the key result when the AI Agent has resolved all user requests. Note that at least one step within the goal must be marked as completed. Multiple steps can be marked as completed.
8. In the **Success Metrics** field, measure the impact of your goal by tracking the following performance metrics:
    - **Cost Savings** — track saved money by entering values in the format `xx.xx`. For example, `150.00` represents `$150`. Make sure your currency is configured in the **Currency Settings** section within the [Project Settings](#determine-what-you-want-to-measure).
    - **Time Saved** — track saved time by entering values in the format `00:00:00` (hours:minutes:seconds). For example, `02:45:00` represents 2 hours and 45 minutes.
9. Click **Save** to save the step.
10. Click **Save** to complete your goal configuration.

Once the steps are added, proceed to the Flow section to integrate your goal with a Flow.

### Add a Goal to a Flow

To add a goal to a Flow, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cognigy.AI Interface.
2. Go to the Project where you want to create a goal. 
3. In the left-side menu of the Project, navigate to **Build > Flows**.
4. On the **Flows** page, either use an existing Flow or click **+ New Flow** to create a new one. 
5. In the Flow editor, add a **Track Goal Process** Node to monitor goal progress within the Flow. 
6. Configure the Node settings:
    - **Select Goal** — choose the goal you recently created, such as `Reduce Call Handling Time`.
    - **Select Steps** — choose the steps within the goal that you want to track. Note that the first selected step must be the initial step. Set the initial step at the beginning of the process you want to track in your Flow. Otherwise, the goal will not be tracked.
7. Click **Save Node** to confirm your changes.

You can add multiple **Track Goal Process** Nodes in the same Flow to track different steps of your goal.

### Track a Goal in the Insights Dashboard

Once a goal and its steps are added to your Flows, you can monitor metrics in the Insights dashboard.

1. Go to the Insights interface by selecting Insights from the left-side menu of the current Project. 
2. In the Insights interface, select **Goals** from the left-side menu. 
3. Use filters to view metrics over a specific time frame.

For example:

- **Cost Savings**. You may see a trend showing how much cost was saved through automation over the past month.
- **Time Saved**. Track how many hours were saved as tasks were handled automatically by the AI Agent instead of a human agent.

For more information on how the data is calculated, refer to [Goals](../../../insights/dashboards/goals.md) in the Insights documentation.

## Other Operations

### Export a Goal as a Package

To reuse a goal in other Projects, you can package the goal.

To package a goal, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cognigy.AI Interface.
2. Go to the Project from which you want to export a goal. 
3. Go to **Build > Goals**. 
4. Hover over the existing goal and click ![vertical-ellipsis](../../../_assets/icons/vertical-ellipsis.svg). 
5. Select **Export as package**. 
6. Once the Package has created, a new [task](../../build/projects.md#tasks), titled **Create package**, will be run. To view the task, click ![task-menu](../../../_assets/icons/task-menu.svg) in the upper-right corner.

When the task is completed, download the Package.

### Delete a Goal

When you delete a goal,
all associated analytics data is deleted and the Track Goal Process Node linked to the goal stops working.
Before deleting the goal, either replace it with another goal in the Flow or remove the linked Node if it's no longer needed.

To delete a goal, follow these steps:

1. Open the Cognigy.AI Interface.
2. Go to the Project in which you want to delete a goal.
3. Go to **Build > Goals**. 
4. Hover over the existing goal and click ![vertical-ellipsis](../../../_assets/icons/vertical-ellipsis.svg). 
5. Select **Delete**. 
6. Confirm the deletion by entering the name of the goal.

The goal will be deleted from the list.

### Delete a Step from a Goal

When you delete a step, all associated analytics data is deleted and the Track Goal Process Node linked to the goal stops tracking this step. 
Before deleting the step, make sure to replace it with another step in the Node.

To delete a step, do the following:

1. Open the Cognigy.AI Interface.
2. Go to the Project in which you want to delete a goal.
3. Go to **Build > Goals**.
4. Select the goal from which you want to delete a step.
5. On the **Goal** page, go to the step you want to delete and click ![recycle bin blue](../../../_assets/icons/recycle-bin-blue.svg). Note that you will not be able to save the goal if this step is the last remaining step or the only completion step.
6. Delete the goal by clicking **Confirm**. 
7. Click **Save**.

The step will be deleted from the list.

## Example

In this example, you will create a Flow named `Book a Flight` and add nodes to it. 
Set up a goal linked to this user journey to track the booking process.
Place the Track Goal Process Nodes and select goal and step after each user action where users submit information,
such as selecting flight details, entering passenger information, and completing payment.
In each Track Goal Process Node, select the goal and step corresponding to the user action.
Then monitor and analyze each step of the booking process.
