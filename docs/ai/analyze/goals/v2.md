# Goals v2

_Goals v2_ are used to track specific user interactions during conversations between end-users and AI Agents that align with your business objectives. These interactions may include actions such as making a purchase, signing up for a newsletter, or completing a form.

By setting goals, you can measure how effectively your AI Agent conversations achieve these objectives, providing valuable insights into user behavior. This helps you optimize and enhance the quality of AI-driven conversations, improving performance and user satisfaction.

## Determine What You Want to Measure

Decide whether you want to track money, time, or both:

- **Money Saved**. Track cost savings. To set the currency, go to **Manage > Settings > Currency** Settings and select a currency type from the **Set Standard Currency** list.
- **Time Saved**. Measure the reduction in time spent.

## Create a Goal

Follow these steps to create a goal in Cognigy.AI:

1. Open the Cognigy.AI Interface.
2. Go to the Project where you want to create a goal.
3. In the left-side menu of the Project, go to **Build > Goals** and click **Create a new goal**.
4. Configure the Goal parameters:
    - **Goal Name** — enter a name that reflects the goal, such as `Reduce Call Handling Time` or `Increase Automation Efficiency`.
    - **Goal Description** — provide a brief description that reflects the goal. For example, `This goal aims to reduce average call handling time by automating common customer requests`.
5. In the **Start Step** section, complete the following fields:
    - **Name** — Provide a descriptive name for the starting step, such as `Initiate AI Agent Conversation`.
    - **Description** — Add a detailed description of the starting step. For example, "This step triggers when a user begins a AI Agent session."
6. In the **Steps** section, click **+ Create Step** and add at least one step to complete the goal configuration.
7. Configure the Step parameters:
    - **Name** — name the step, for example, `Customer Request Handled`.
    - **Description** — describe the step, such as `This step captures when the AI Agent successfully resolves a customer request`.
    - **Mark Step as Total Completion Point** — Optional. Enable this setting to mark the current step as the point where the goal is considered fully completed. For example, this could be when the AI Agent has resolved all user requests.
8. In the **Success Metrics** field, quantify the impact of your goal by tracking:
    - **Money Saved** — enter values in the format `xxx.xx` (for example, `150.00` for `$150`). Ensure your currency settings are configured in the **Settings** section.
    - **Time Saved** — choose the time measurement unit (minutes or hours) and specify the time saved, such as 15 minutes per request.
9. Click **Save** to finalize your goal configuration.

Once the steps are added, proceed to the Flow section to integrate your goal with a Flow.

## Add Goals to a Flow

1. Open the Cognigy.AI Interface.
2. Go to the Project where you want to create a goal. 
3. Navigate to **Build > Flows** in the Project's left-side menu. 
4. On the **Flows** page, either use an existing Flow or click **+ New Flow** to create a new one. 
5. In the Flow editor, add a **Track Goal Process** Node to monitor goal progress within the Flow. 
6. Configure the Node settings:
    - **Select Goal** — choose the goal you recently created, such as `Reduce Call Handling Time`.
    - **Select Steps** — choose the steps within the goal that you want to track. 
    - Click **Save Node** to confirm your changes.

You can add multiple **Track Goal Process** Nodes in the same Flow to track different actions or steps.

## Track Goals in the Insights Dashboard

Once goals are added to your Flows, you can monitor metrics in the Insights dashboard.

1. Go to the Insights interface by selecting Insights from the left-side menu of the current Project. 
2. In the Insights interface, select **Goals** from the left-side menu. 
3. Use filters to view metrics over a specific time frame.

For example:

- **Cost Savings**. You may observe a trend showing how much cost was saved through automation over the past month.
- **Time Saved**. Track how many hours were saved as tasks were handled automatically by the AI Agent instead of a human agent.
