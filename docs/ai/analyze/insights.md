- **Metric Tracking**. Insights provide metrics related to user interactions, engagement levels, conversation flow, and more, helping track the performance of their chat and voice AI Agents over time.
- **Performance Analysis**. You can analyze the effectiveness of their conversational AI implementations by examining metrics such as response times, completion rates, user satisfaction scores, and goal achievements.
- **Data Export**. Insights offer the ability to export reports for further analysis in CSV format.
