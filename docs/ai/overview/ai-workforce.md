## Cognigy's AI Workforce

Cognigy.AI introduces a transformative approach to customer service and engagement through its AI Workforce, consisting of voice and text-based AI Agents and AI Copilot functionalities. These AI-driven solutions are designed to fulfill two pivotal roles in the customer service ecosystem.

### Self-Service AI Agent

Cognigy's AI Agents are at the forefront of overcoming the CX gap by providing round-the-clock self-service capabilities. These AI Agents are engineered to understand and resolve customer inquiries autonomously, leading to significant improvements in customer experience while boosting operational efficiency. By handling a vast array of customer queries, these agents ensure immediate response times, thereby enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty.

Key Benefits:

- Improving Customer Experience and Efficiency: The deployment of AI Agents leads to faster resolution times, which directly contributes to a better customer experience and more efficient service operations.

### AI Copilot

In response to rising demand for AI support
driven by labor shortages and the need for scalable customer service solutions,
Cognigy's AI Copilot stands out as a significant innovation.
It serves as an intelligent assistant for human agents,
offering suggestions, automating routine tasks, and managing overflow during peak times.
This collaboration between AI and human agents facilitates the effective scalability of customer service operations
without compromising quality.

Key Benefits:

- Addressing Labor Shortages: The AI Copilot function alleviates the impact of labor shortages by augmenting the capabilities of existing staff, allowing them to handle more complex inquiries and tasks.
- Enhancing Human Capabilities: By teaming up with human agents, the AI Copilot ensures that the AI Workforce and human staff complement each otherâ€™s strengths, leading to optimized customer service outcomes.
