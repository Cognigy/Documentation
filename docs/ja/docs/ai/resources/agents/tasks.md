# Tasks

Certain activities, like training **Intents**, importing **Snapshots** or the creation of a new **Agent**, generate so-called **Tasks**. A **Task** is an asynchronous process that can run in the background and is tied to the notification system. 

## Task Panel

The Task Panel can be used to get an overview of current (and previous) Tasks and serves as a high-level change log for relevant activities. It can be access by clicking on the Task icon at the top-right of the screen.

<div class="right-image">

</div>

The Task Panel shows both running as well as completed Tasks that are marked with "done".

## Notifications

Whenever a Task has been succesfully completed, a Success Notification is shown at the top-right of the user interface.
