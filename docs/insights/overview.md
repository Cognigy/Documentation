# Cognigy Insights 

**Cognigy Insights** replaces our previous static analytics dashboard and provides you with the tools you need to improve the customer experience your AI agents provide.
Insights features a range of key metrics, helping you to understand the usage and the performance of your bots.

Cognigy.AI offers both integrated analytics dashboards, as well as an OData access, allowing you to build your own dashboards, by retrieving your raw analytics data.

## Dashboards

Cognigy Insights co-exists side-by-side with Cognigy.AI and is tightly integrated with all of Cognigy's products.
Insights features a variety of dashboards and explorers to highlight different data types, enabling you to track your customers' behavior and the success of your AI Agents. Additionally, all collected data is accessible through OData.
Insights operates within individual Cognigy.AI Projects. This allows you to analyze data specific to each Project and switch between Projects seamlessly. However, comparing data across Projects simultaneously is not supported.

Access Cognigy Insights by opening the left-side menu in a Cognigy.AI Project and selecting **Insights**. To switch Projects within Insights, use the dropdown menu in the upper-left corner.
When switching from Cognigy.AI to Cognigy Insights, you will be redirected to the Insights **Dashboard** section, starting on the Overview dashboard.

Cognigy Insights features a variety of different dashboards and explorers, which visualize key metrics of your currently selected AI Agent. 

Insights provides the following Dashboards:

- [Overview](dashboards/overview.md)
- [Engagement](dashboards/engagement.md)
- [NLU Performance](dashboards/nlu-performance.md)
- [Live Agent](dashboards/live-agent.md)

And additionally a set of Explorers:

## Filters

Cognigy Insights features global and local filters. The **Filter Bar** only displays a small portion of the available filters openly. In order to access all filters, you have to click on **more filters**. This list includes both global and local filters. Once you have changed the filters, all the data visualized in any location will respect your filter configuration.

**Global Filters**

Global filters apply across the entirety of Cognigy Insights. Once you set them up, they persist throughout your session, even if you change from one dashboard to another.

**Local Filters**

Local filters are specific filters, which are only available for one or a few different dashboards. When you switch from one board to another, they will be temporarily disabled, but not removed from your selection.

## User menu

You can find the [user menu](../ai/administer/user-menu/overview.md) in the upper-right corner of the screen.

## Main menu

The Insights left-side menu displays all available dashboards and explorers. This menu allows you to easily switch between different dashboards and explorers to analyze your AI Agent's performance.

You can always identify the currently selected view in two ways: it's highlighted in light blue-gray in the menu bar and displayed in the header at the top of your screen.

The left-side menu also allows you to switch back to Cognigy.AI by clicking **Cognigy.AI**.
