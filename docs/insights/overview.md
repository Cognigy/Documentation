# Cognigy Insights 

**Cognigy Insights** replaces our previous static analytics dashboard and provides you with the tools you need to improve the customer experience your AI agents provide.
Insights features a range of key metrics, helping you to understand the usage and the performance of your bots.

Cognigy.AI offers both integrated analytics dashboards, as well as an OData access, allowing you to build your own dashboards, by retrieving your raw analytics data.

As of release v4.10, Cognigy provides a completely new designed Analytics solution for Insights.

## Dashboards

Cognigy Insights co-exists side-by-side with Cognigy.AI and is tightly integrated with all of Cognigy's products.
It features a variety of different dashboards and explorers to highlight different data types, which allow you to keep track of your customer's behaviour and the success of your AI agents. All of the collected data is also accessible through OData.

You can access Cognigy Insights, by opening the sidebar menu in Cognigy.AI and click on **Insights**, previously this had led to our [Analytics](../ai/analyze/collecting-data.md) application.
In order to view the data correlating to a specific agent, you can select one from the dropdown menu in the upper left area.

!!! note
    When you are in an agent-specific route in Cognigy.AI (Agent is selected), you should see Insights in the user menu pop-up. You can navigate to Insights of that Agent when you click on the menu item.

When switching from Cognigy.AI to Cognigy Insights, you will be redirected to the Insights **Dashboard** section, starting on the Overview dashboard.
