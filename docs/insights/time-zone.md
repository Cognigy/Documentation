# Time Zone

Insights can present time-based data, accounting to a user's time zone. 

!!! note 
    In OData feed time is always in UTC format. You should take this into account if you compare it with Insights.

## Changing the preferred Time Zone

By default, Insights uses the time zone of your device. You can override this in **My Profile**. 

This is especially beneficial, when you travel a lot, and your device time zone is updated based on your location, or when you have multinational AI Agents with users all over the globe.

To change your time zone preferences:

1. Click on the user icon in the top-right corner.
2. Select **My Profile**.
3. Choose preferred time zone in the **Select Time zone** input.

!!! note
    Custom time zone preferences are stored inside the browser storage, means you need to select custom time zone preference again if you change the device and/or the browser.
