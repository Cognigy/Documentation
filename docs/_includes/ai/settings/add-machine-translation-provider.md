        | Translation Provider API Key  | Enter your unique API key provided by Microsoft Translator. It's necessary for authentication and allows you to access translation services.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
        | Request Retries               | Enter how often Cognigy.AI should attempt to call the translation provider if an error occurs during the initial request. For example, if you set it to `3`, Cognigy.AI tries three times before giving up on a translation request.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
        | Request Timeout               | Enter how long Cognigy.AI should wait for a response from the translation provider after making a request, in milliseconds. If the provider doesn't respond within this time frame, it's considered a timeout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
        | Sentence Cache Expiry Timeout | Enter how long translations should be kept in the cache before they are considered outdated and removed. The default value is `84,600` seconds, which corresponds to 1 day. For no caching, set it to `0`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
        | Custom API Base URL           | This setting is optional. If you have specific requirements or need to connect to a custom instance of the Microsoft Translator API different from the default one `https://api.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com/`, you can use this field to specify a custom base URL. It allows you to define the URL, including the protocol scheme, for example `https://api-eur.cognitive.microsofttranslator.com`, to tailor the API connection to your needs. |
        | Custom Subscription Region    | This setting is optional. It represents the location or region of your Azure AI Translator resource. You may need to use this field when calling this API, especially if you have specified a specific region in your Azure account.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
