??? info "Filter Transcript Messages"
    By default, Cognigy.AI sends the full conversation transcript as a single message once the handover to Genesys occurs. Additionally, you can filter out empty or unsupported messages to keep the transcript relevant and concise:

    - **Filter unsupported messages** — if the system detects a message in an unsupported format, such as `UNSUPPORTED_STRUCTURE_DATA`, the system will exclude the message from the conversation transcript. To activate this feature, use the `FEATURE_FILTER_UNSUPPORTED_MESSAGES_HANDOVER_PROVIDER: "true"` feature flag.
    - **Filter empty messages** — if a user sends a blank message with no text or content, the system will exclude the message from the conversation transcript. To activate this feature, use the `FEATURE_FILTER_EMPTY_MESSAGES_HANDOVER_PROVIDER: "true"` feature flag.
