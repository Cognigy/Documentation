    If you are using Live Agent as a handover provider, you can forward information from the widget to the **Reply to User** section by clicking ![forwarder](https://docs.cognigy.com/_assets/icons/forwarder.svg) and then sending it to the end user.

    For other providers, use the alternative option **Enable copy to clipboard button** to activate the Copy button on the tile.
    For Salesforce, to activate the Copy button, update your Salesforce integration using [this guide](https://github.com/Cognigy/salesforce-integrations?tab=readme-ov-file#update).
