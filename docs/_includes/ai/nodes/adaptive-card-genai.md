You can also use Generative AI to create a new adaptive card or improve an existing one. Before using it, ensure that you are connected to one of the [Generative AI providers](../../../empower/generative-ai.md#prerequisites).

To activate this feature, follow these steps: 

1. Select the **Adaptive Card** output type.
2. On the right side of the **Output type** list, click ![the Gen AI Icon](../../../../_assets/icons/beta.svg).
3. In the **Generate Node Output** section, instruct the Generative AI model how to improve the current Adaptive Card. For example, `Create a form with a customer name field and a date input field`.
4. Click **Generate**. The adaptive card will be generated.
5. Iteratively improve the resulting Adaptive Card by giving further instructions in the **Generate Node Output** section. For example, `Add a flight number field`.
6. Click **Generate**. The existing adaptive card will be updated.

To navigate between your inputs, use ![back arrow](../../../../_assets/icons/back-arrow.svg) ![beta](../../../../_assets/icons/next-arrow.svg).
