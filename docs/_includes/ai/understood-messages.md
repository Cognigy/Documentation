!!! warning "Deprecation of Understood Messages"
    With Cognigy.AI 4.91, the Understood Messages concept was deprecated, with removal from the Insights reports scheduled for version 2025.19. Use the [Goals and Tasks](https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/analyze/goals-and-tasks/overview/) concepts to evaluate whether your AI Agent understood a particular phrase.
    
    Respectively, the OData endpoint `understood` field was deprecated in the same version, with full removal scheduled for version 2025.24. Use the [Goals collection](https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/analyze/odata#goals) in the Cognigy.AI OData endpoint.

    Refer to the list of all upcoming removals on the [Deprecations and Removals](https://docs.cognigy.com/release-notes/deprecations-and-removals/) page.
