## Log in to Cognigy.AI

You can login with your Cognigy.AI credentials or, optionally, with single sign-on (SSO), if you have [set up login with SSO](../../ai/installation/single-sign-on-saml2.md). If you have [enforced login with SSO](../../ai/installation/single-sign-on-saml2.md#enforce-login-with-sso), you can only log in with SSO.

### "Log in with credentials"

        - **E-Mail** — the email you provided to your Cognigy.AI admin to register your Cognigy.AI account.
        - **Password** — the password you received from your Cognigy.AI admin. If you don't remember your password, you can [reset your password](../../ai/installation/access-to-cognigy-ai.md#reset-password).

    2. _(Optional)_ If you want to stay logged in after you close your session, activate the **Remember me** checkbox.
