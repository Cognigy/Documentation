To apply a model, follow these steps:

1. In the left-side menu of the Project, go to **Manage > Settings**. 
2. Go to the section based on your use case for using a model:
    - **Generative AI Settings**. In the **Generative AI Settings** section, activate **Enable Generative AI Features**. This setting is toggled on by default if you have previously set up the Generative AI credentials.
    - **Knowledge AI Settings**. Use this section if you need to add a model for Knowledge AI. Select a model for the **Knowledge Search** and **Answer Extraction** features. Refer to the [list of standard models](https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/empower/llms/model-support-by-feature/) and find the models that support these features. 
3. Navigate to the desired feature and select a model from the list. If there are no models available for the selected feature, the system will automatically select **None**. Save changes.
