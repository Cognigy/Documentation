Cognigy AI Agents use English as the default language. However, you can customize the language of your Flow to match your requirements when needed.

To create a locale, follow these steps:

1. In the left-side menu of the Project, go to **Manage > Localization**.
2. Click **+ Create new Locale**.
3. In the **Name** field, enter a unique name of the locale. This name will be displayed in the Flow.
4. From the **NLU Language** list, select a language for your locale.
5. From the **Fallback Locale** list, select a locale that will be used as default when a specific language is not available.
6. Click **Save & Build**.
