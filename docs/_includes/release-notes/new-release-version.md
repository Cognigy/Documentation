!!! warning "Announcement: New Versioning Concept"
    We are excited to announce a change in our software versioning system!
    This new system will make it easier for you to track releases by showing both their order and year, providing clearer insight into our updates and patches.
    Moving forward, we will use a new format: `YEAR.MINOR_RELEASE.PATCH_LEVEL`, where:

    - `YEAR` is the year of the release, for example, `2025`. 
    - `MINOR_RELEASE` is the Nth minor release of the year, for example, the 10th minor release in 2025 is `10`.
    - `PATCH` is the Nth patch for a minor release, for example, the 1st patch for the 10th minor release is `1`. If no patches are released, the number is `0`.
