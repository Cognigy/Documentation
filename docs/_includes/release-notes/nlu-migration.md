!!! note "Cognigy NLU: from V1 to V2"
    Starting from release 4.60.0, we will only provide bug fixes for the old NLP services if they are critical. The old NLP services will be fully deprecated with release 4.64.0, at which point all on-premises customers should have migrated. After the 4.64.0 release, the old NLP services will no longer be available. To migrate to the new version, refer to the [Cognigy NLU: from V1 to V2](https://docs.cognigy.com/ai/installation/migration/from-nlu-v1-to-v2-migration/) guide.
