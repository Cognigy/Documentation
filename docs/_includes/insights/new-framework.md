!!! note "New Insights framework"
    We are introducing a new architecture framework for Cognigy Insights, which significantly enhances the application's data processing capacity. This upgraded framework not only improves overall performance but also minimizes loading times for report data. To use this framework, migration is required.

    The migration to the new framework is not linked to a specific release. We start with a few dedicated SaaS customers, inform them, and provide assistance for migration. For on-premises customers, the migration guide will be provided soon.

    Afterward, we migrate the remaining shared SaaS and dedicated SaaS customers.
