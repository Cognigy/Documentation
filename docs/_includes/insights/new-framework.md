!!! note "New Insights framework"
    We are introducing a new architecture for Cognigy Insights, which significantly enhances the application's data processing capacity. This upgraded framework not only improves overall performance but also minimizes loading times for dashboard data.

    The framework migration is not linked to a specific release. We will start with a few dedicated SaaS customers, inform them, and provide assistance for migration. Afterward, we will create guides for on-premises customers and then migrate the remaining shared SaaS and dedicated SaaS customers.
