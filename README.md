# [Deprecated] Cognigy Product Documentation

> [!CAUTION]
> The repository has been deprecated and will be archived on November 20th. If you have any integrations based on this repository, please migrate them to the [new repository](https://github.com/Cognigy/docs) before that date. [All issues](https://github.com/Cognigy/Documentation/issues/) raised in the deprecated repository will be closed, and related tasks in the Technical Writers backlog will be reviewed according to their priorities. Weâ€™ll keep you informed of any updates regarding your issue and will notify you when the documentation is updated based on your feedback.

This repository contains the new product documentation for Cognigy, which is hosted on [docs.cognigy.com](https://docs.cognigy.com/). 
It includes documentation for all Cognigy products such as Cognigy.AI, Insights, Webchat, Voice Gateway, and Live Agent. 
The documentation is written in Markdown files and compiled to static HTML using the [MkDocs framework](https://www.mkdocs.org). 

We use a modified theme based on [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), which has been extended to match Cognigy corporate identity.
