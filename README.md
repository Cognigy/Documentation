The repository stores documentation for all Cognigy products, such as Cognigy.AI, Cognigy Insights, and the Cognigy WebchatWidget. The documentation is written as Markdown files and compiled to static HTML using the [MKDocs framework](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

We use a modified theme based on [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), which we have extended to match our own corporate identity.
