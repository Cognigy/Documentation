# Cognigy Product Documentation

This repository contains the new product documentation for Cognigy, which is hosted on [docs.cognigy.com](https://docs.cognigy.com/). 
It includes documentation for all Cognigy products such as Cognigy.AI, Insights, Webchat, Voice Gateway, and Live Agent. 
The documentation is written in Markdown files and compiled to static HTML using the [MkDocs framework](https://www.mkdocs.org). 

We use a modified theme based on [mkdocs-material](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/), which has been extended to match Cognigy corporate identity.
